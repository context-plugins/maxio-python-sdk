The Maxio SDK for Python provides access to the Maxio REST APIs from Python applications.

Maxio Advanced Billing (formerly Chargify) provides an HTTP-based API that conforms to the principles of REST.
One of the many reasons to use Advanced Billing is the immense feature set and [client libraries](page:development-tools/client-libraries).
The Maxio API returns JSON responses as the primary and recommended format, but XML is also provided as a backwards compatible option for merchants who require it.

## Steps to make your first Maxio Advanced Billing API call

1. [Sign-up](https://app.chargify.com/signup/maxio-billing-sandbox) or [log-in](https://app.chargify.com/login.html) to your [test site](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24250712113165-Testing-Overview) account.
2. [Setup authentication](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24294819360525-API-Keys) credentials.
3. [Submit an API request and verify the response](page:development-tools/client-libraries#make-your-first-maxio-advanced-billing-api-request).
5. Test the Advanced Billing [integrations](https://www.maxio.com/integrations).

Next, you can explore [authentication methods](page:introduction/authentication), [basic concepts](page:introduction/basic-concepts/connected-sites) for interacting with Advanced Billing via the API, and the entire set of [application-based documentation](https://docs.maxio.com/hc/en-us) to aid in your discovery of the product.

### Request Example

The following example uses the curl command-line tool to make an API request.

**Request**

    curl -u <api_key>:x -H Accept:application/json -H Content-Type:application/json https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions.json

## Installation

Add the Python SDK to your project from its folder, with whichever package manager your project uses. Give each tool a path containing a slash, such as `../maxio` — a bare folder name is looked up on PyPI instead, and resolves to whatever project holds that name there:

```bash
pip install <path-to-sdk>
```

```bash
uv add <path-to-sdk>
```

```bash
poetry add <path-to-sdk>
```

## Quick Start

### Synchronous client

Construct `MaxioClient` with keyword arguments, and call `close()` when you are done. Every argument is optional; the full list is in the [SDK map](sdk-map.md).

```python
from maxio import MaxioClient
from maxio.core import BasicAuthCredentials

client = MaxioClient(
    basic_auth=BasicAuthCredentials(username="YOUR_USERNAME", password="YOUR_PASSWORD"), environment="us"
)

# TODO: call endpoints here -- see api-reference.md

client.close()
```

Alternatively, scope it -- `with MaxioClient(...) as client:` closes the pool on exit; see [Best Practices](#best-practices).

`Client` is exported as an alias of `MaxioClient`, so `from maxio import Client` also works.

The SDK accepts every model-typed input in two interchangeable spellings, both type-checked: the typed model, or a plain dict with the same keys -- the `OrDict` and `Model | ModelDict` unions in the [SDK map](sdk-map.md). Pick whichever suits the call site: the dict form needs no import, while the model form adds a keyword-checked constructor and editor completion.

### Asynchronous client

`AsyncMaxioClient` mirrors `MaxioClient` with **identical method names**, and every endpoint method is a coroutine. It takes the same arguments, with some differences -- for example, the transport argument is `custom_async_http_client`.

```python
from asyncio import run

from maxio import AsyncMaxioClient
from maxio.core import BasicAuthCredentials


async def main() -> None:
    client = AsyncMaxioClient(
        basic_auth=BasicAuthCredentials(username="YOUR_USERNAME", password="YOUR_PASSWORD"), environment="us"
    )
    # TODO: call endpoints here, awaiting each -- see api-reference.md
    await client.aclose()


run(main())
```

Alternatively, scope it -- `async with AsyncMaxioClient(...) as client:` closes the pool on exit. Only the async spelling is `aclose`, matching httpx2; see [Best Practices](#best-practices).

`AsyncClient` is the exported alias. Each client accepts **only** its own transport argument; passing the other's is a `TypeError` at runtime and an error under mypy.

## Usage

Two generated references cover the SDK; each answers a different question:

| Reference | For |
| --- | --- |
| **[API Reference](api-reference.md)** | Usage guidance for a single **parsed** operation: `client.<group>.<operation>(...)` returns the typed payload and raises `ApiError` on any non-2xx, with `.error` the typed error body, or `RawError` for a status the operation does not document. |
| **[Raw API Reference](raw-api-reference.md)** | The same for the **raw** variant: `client.<group>.with_raw_response.<operation>(...)` returns `ApiResult[T, E]` and never raises for an API error. |

Both API references carry every one of the 268 operations, with a sync and an async sample and a parameter table each.

## SDK map

This SDK ships a generated **SDK map** -- [`sdk-map.md`](sdk-map.md) -- a deterministic, lookup-oriented table of contents of the SDK's Python surface, generated by APIMatic alongside this SDK.

Consult the map before scanning or grepping the source: it answers call-level contract questions by lookup, and for anything it does not carry -- model shapes, enum values, an endpoint's route or behavioural prose -- it names the one source file to read. How to read the map itself, including the SDK-wide defaults its rows rely on, is stated at the top of [`sdk-map.md`](sdk-map.md).

## Best Practices

> [!TIP]
> Use a **single `MaxioClient` instance** for the lifetime of your application and reuse it across
> all requests. Each instance owns its own connection pool, so an instance per request forfeits
> connection reuse and leaks pools that are never closed.

Match the disposal to the client's lifetime: an application-lifetime client is closed once at shutdown with `close()` / `aclose()`; where the lifetime fits a block, `with MaxioClient() as client:` / `async with AsyncMaxioClient() as client:` releases it automatically. Both are idempotent, but a closed client is not reusable: the next call raises. The client closes **whatever transport it holds**, including one you supplied via `custom_http_client` / `custom_async_http_client`; if you intend to reuse your own transport across clients, don't hand its lifetime to a `with` block.

**Retries are on by default**: a failed idempotent request — a retryable status or no response at all — is sent again up to three times before the call gives up. Pass `retry_options=0` to turn it off, for instance in a test that stubs an error response; the policy and its defaults are under **Retries** in the SDK map.
