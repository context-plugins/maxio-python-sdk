# Maxio Advanced Billing SDK

The Maxio Advanced Billing SDK for Python provides access to the Maxio Advanced Billing REST APIs from Python applications.

Maxio Advanced Billing (formerly Chargify) provides an HTTP-based API that conforms to the principles of REST.
One of the many reasons to use Advanced Billing is the immense feature set and [client libraries](page:development-tools/client-libraries).
The Maxio API returns JSON responses as the primary and recommended format, but XML is also provided as a backwards compatible option for merchants who require it.

## Steps to make your first Maxio Advanced Billing API call

1. [Sign-up](https://app.chargify.com/signup/maxio-billing-sandbox) or [log-in](https://app.chargify.com/login.html) to your [test site](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24250712113165-Testing-Overview) account.
2. [Setup authentication](https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24294819360525-API-Keys) credentials.
3. [Submit an API request and verify the response](page:development-tools/client-libraries#make-your-first-maxio-advanced-billing-api-request).
5. Test the Advanced Billing [integrations](https://www.maxio.com/integrations).

Next, you can explore [authentication methods](page:introduction/authentication), [basic concepts](page:introduction/basic-concepts/connected-sites) for interacting with Advanced Billing via the API, and the entire set of [application-based documentation](https://docs.maxio.com/hc/en-us) to aid in your discovery of the product.

### Request Example

The following example uses the curl command-line tool to make an API request.

**Request**

    curl -u <api_key>:x -H Accept:application/json -H Content-Type:application/json https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions.json

## Installation

Install the Python SDK from PyPI, with whichever package manager your project uses:

```bash
pip install maxio-advanced-billing
```

```bash
uv add maxio-advanced-billing
```

```bash
poetry add maxio-advanced-billing
```

---

## Quick Start

### Synchronous client

Construct `MaxioAdvancedBillingClient` with keyword arguments, and call `close()` when you are done. Every argument is optional; the full list is in the [SDK map](sdk-map.md).

```python
from maxio_advanced_billing import MaxioAdvancedBillingClient
from maxio_advanced_billing.core import BasicAuthCredentials

client = MaxioAdvancedBillingClient(
    basic_auth=BasicAuthCredentials(username="YOUR_USERNAME", password="YOUR_PASSWORD"),
    bearer_auth="YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN",
    environment="us",
)

# TODO: call endpoints here -- see api-reference.md

client.close()
```

Alternatively, scope it -- `with MaxioAdvancedBillingClient(...) as client:` closes the pool on exit; see [Best Practices](#best-practices).

`Client` is exported as an alias of `MaxioAdvancedBillingClient`, so `from maxio_advanced_billing import Client` also works.

The SDK accepts every model-typed input in two interchangeable spellings, both type-checked: the typed model, or a plain dict with the same keys -- the `OrDict` and `Model | ModelDict` unions in the [SDK map](sdk-map.md). Pick whichever suits the call site: the dict form needs no import, while the model form adds a keyword-checked constructor and editor completion.

### Asynchronous client

`AsyncMaxioAdvancedBillingClient` mirrors `MaxioAdvancedBillingClient` with **identical method names**, and every endpoint method is a coroutine. It takes the same arguments, with some differences -- for example, the transport argument is `custom_async_http_client`.

```python
from asyncio import run

from maxio_advanced_billing import AsyncMaxioAdvancedBillingClient
from maxio_advanced_billing.core import BasicAuthCredentials


async def main() -> None:
    client = AsyncMaxioAdvancedBillingClient(
        basic_auth=BasicAuthCredentials(username="YOUR_USERNAME", password="YOUR_PASSWORD"),
        bearer_auth="YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN",
        environment="us",
    )
    # TODO: call endpoints here, awaiting each -- see api-reference.md
    await client.aclose()


run(main())
```

Alternatively, scope it -- `async with AsyncMaxioAdvancedBillingClient(...) as client:` closes the pool on exit. Only the async spelling is `aclose`, matching httpx; see [Best Practices](#best-practices).

`AsyncClient` is the exported alias. Each client accepts **only** its own transport argument; passing the other's is a `TypeError` at runtime and an error under mypy.

## Usage

Two generated references cover the SDK; each answers a different question:

| Reference | For |
| --- | --- |
| **[API Reference](api-reference.md)** | Usage guidance for a single **parsed** operation: `client.<group>.<operation>(...)` returns the typed payload and raises `ApiError` on any non-2xx, with `.error` the typed error body, or `RawError` for a status the operation does not document. |
| **[Raw API Reference](raw-api-reference.md)** | The same for the **raw** variant: `client.<group>.with_raw_response.<operation>(...)` returns `ApiResult[T, E]` and never raises for an API error. |

Both API references carry every one of the 250 operations, with a sync and an async sample and a parameter table each.

## SDK map

This SDK ships a generated **SDK map** -- [`sdk-map.md`](sdk-map.md) -- a deterministic, lookup-oriented table of contents of the SDK's Python surface, generated by APIMatic alongside this SDK.

Consult the map before scanning or grepping the source: it answers call-level contract questions by lookup, and for anything it does not carry -- model shapes, enum values, an endpoint's route or behavioural prose -- it names the one source file to read. How to read the map itself, including the SDK-wide defaults its rows rely on, is stated at the top of [`sdk-map.md`](sdk-map.md).

## Best Practices

> [!TIP]
> Use a **single `MaxioAdvancedBillingClient` instance** for the lifetime of your application and reuse it across
> all requests. Each instance owns its own connection pool, so an instance per request forfeits
> connection reuse and leaks pools that are never closed.

Match the disposal to the client's lifetime: an application-lifetime client is closed once at shutdown with `close()` / `aclose()`; where the lifetime fits a block, `with MaxioAdvancedBillingClient() as client:` / `async with AsyncMaxioAdvancedBillingClient() as client:` releases it automatically. Both are idempotent, but a closed client is not reusable: the next call raises. The client closes **whatever transport it holds**, including one you supplied via `custom_http_client` / `custom_async_http_client`; if you intend to reuse your own transport across clients, don't hand its lifetime to a `with` block.
