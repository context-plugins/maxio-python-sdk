        Subscriptions should be in the ``active`` or ``trialing`` state in order to be migrated.

        (For backwards compatibility reasons, it is possible to migrate a subscription that is in the ``trial_ended``
        state via the API, however this is not recommended. Since ``trial_ended`` is an end-of-life state, the

        Full documentation on how to record Migrations in the Advanced Billing UI can be located `here

        ## Failed Migrations

        Important note: One of the most common ways that a migration can fail is when the attempt is made to migrate a
        subscription to its current product.
