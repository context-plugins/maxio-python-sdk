        features, it is possible to add existing subscriptions to subscription groups.

        Passing ``group`` parameters with a ``target`` containing a ``type`` and optional ``id`` is all that's needed.
        When the ``target`` parameter specifies a ``"customer"`` or ``"subscription"`` that is already part of a
        hierarchy, the subscription will become a member of the customer's subscription group. If the target customer or
        subscription is not part of a subscription group, a new group will be created and the subscription will become
        part of the group with the specified target customer set as the responsible payer for the group's subscriptions.

        **Note:** In order to add an existing subscription to a subscription group, it must belong to either the same
        customer record as the target, or be within the same customer hierarchy.

        Rather than specifying a customer, the ``target`` parameter could instead simply have a value of
        * ``"self"`` which indicates the subscription will be paid for not by some other customer, but by the
            subscribing customer,
        * ``"parent"`` which indicates the subscription will be paid for by the subscribing customer's parent within a
            customer hierarchy, or
        * ``"eldest"`` which indicates the subscription will be paid for by the root-level customer in the subscribing
            customer's hierarchy.

        To create a new subscription into a subscription group, reference the following: `Create Subscription in a

        features, it is possible to add existing subscriptions to subscription groups.

        Passing ``group`` parameters with a ``target`` containing a ``type`` and optional ``id`` is all that's needed.
        When the ``target`` parameter specifies a ``"customer"`` or ``"subscription"`` that is already part of a
        hierarchy, the subscription will become a member of the customer's subscription group. If the target customer or
        subscription is not part of a subscription group, a new group will be created and the subscription will become
        part of the group with the specified target customer set as the responsible payer for the group's subscriptions.

        **Note:** In order to add an existing subscription to a subscription group, it must belong to either the same
        customer record as the target, or be within the same customer hierarchy.

        Rather than specifying a customer, the ``target`` parameter could instead simply have a value of
        * ``"self"`` which indicates the subscription will be paid for not by some other customer, but by the
            subscribing customer,
        * ``"parent"`` which indicates the subscription will be paid for by the subscribing customer's parent within a
            customer hierarchy, or
        * ``"eldest"`` which indicates the subscription will be paid for by the root-level customer in the subscribing
            customer's hierarchy.

        To create a new subscription into a subscription group, reference the following: `Create Subscription in a

        features, it is possible to add existing subscriptions to subscription groups.

        Passing ``group`` parameters with a ``target`` containing a ``type`` and optional ``id`` is all that's needed.
        When the ``target`` parameter specifies a ``"customer"`` or ``"subscription"`` that is already part of a
        hierarchy, the subscription will become a member of the customer's subscription group. If the target customer or
        subscription is not part of a subscription group, a new group will be created and the subscription will become
        part of the group with the specified target customer set as the responsible payer for the group's subscriptions.

        **Note:** In order to add an existing subscription to a subscription group, it must belong to either the same
        customer record as the target, or be within the same customer hierarchy.

        Rather than specifying a customer, the ``target`` parameter could instead simply have a value of
        * ``"self"`` which indicates the subscription will be paid for not by some other customer, but by the
            subscribing customer,
        * ``"parent"`` which indicates the subscription will be paid for by the subscribing customer's parent within a
            customer hierarchy, or
        * ``"eldest"`` which indicates the subscription will be paid for by the root-level customer in the subscribing
            customer's hierarchy.

        To create a new subscription into a subscription group, reference the following: `Create Subscription in a
