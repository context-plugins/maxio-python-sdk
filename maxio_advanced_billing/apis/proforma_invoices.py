            status: The current status of the invoice. Allowed Values: draft, open, paid, pending, voided
            page: Result records are organized in pages. By default, the first page of results is displayed. The page
                parameter specifies a page number of results to fetch. You can start navigating through the pages to
                consume the results. You do this by passing in a page parameter. Retrieve the next page by adding
                ?page=2 to the query string. If there are no results to return, then an empty result set will be
                returned. Use in query ``page=1``.
            per_page: This parameter indicates how many records to fetch in each request. Default value is 20. The
                maximum allowed values is 200; any per_page value over 200 will be changed to 200. Use in query
                ``per_page=200``.
            direction: The sort direction of the returned invoices.
            line_items: Include line items data.
            discounts: Include discounts data.
            taxes: Include taxes data.
            credits: Include credits data.
