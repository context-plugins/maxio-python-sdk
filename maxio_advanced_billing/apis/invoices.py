class Invoices:
    def __init__(self, client: RawClient, server: Server, auth: AuthSchemes) -> None:
        self._with_raw_response = InvoicesWithRawResponse(client, server, auth)

    def create_invoice(
        self,
        subscription_id: int,
        *,
        body: CreateInvoiceRequest | CreateInvoiceRequestDict | None = None,
        request_options: RequestOptionsOrDict | None = None,
    ) -> InvoiceResponse:
        """Creates an ad hoc invoice.

        ### Basic Behavior

        You can create a basic invoice by sending an array of line items to this endpoint. Each line item, at a minimum,
        must include a title, a quantity and a unit price. Example:

        ```json
        {
          "invoice": {
            "line_items": [
              {
                "title": "A Product",
                "quantity": 12,
                "unit_price": "150.00"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
        ```

        ### Catalog items Instead of creating custom products like in above example, You can pass existing items like
        products, components.

        ```json
        {
          "invoice": {
            "line_items": [
              {
                "product_id": "handle:gold-product",
                "quantity": 2,
              }
            ]
          }
        }
        ```


        The price for each line item will be calculated as well as a total due amount for the invoice. Multiple line
        items can be sent.

        ### Line item types When defining a line item, You can choose one of 3 types for a line item: #### Custom item
        As shown in the basic behavior example, You can pass ``title`` and ``unit_price`` for custom item. #### Product
        id Product handle (with handle: prefix) or id from the scope of current subscription's site can be provided with
        ``product_id``. By default ``unit_price`` is taken from product's default price point, but can be overwritten by
        passing ``unit_price`` or ``product_price_point_id``. If ``product_id`` is used, following fields cannot be
        used: ``title``, ``component_id``. #### Component id Component handle (with handle: prefix) or id from the scope
        of current subscription's site can be provided with ``component_id``. If ``component_id`` is used, following
        fields cannot be used: ``title``, ``product_id``. By default ``unit_price`` is taken from product's default
        price point, but can be overwritten by passing ``unit_price`` or ``price_point_id``. At this moment price points
        are supported only for quantity based, on/off and metered components. For prepaid and event based billing
        components ``unit_price`` is required.

        ### Coupons When creating ad hoc invoice, new discounts can be applied in following way:

        ```json
        {
          "invoice": {
            "line_items": [
              {
                "product_id": "handle:gold-product",
                "quantity": 1
              }
            ],
            "coupons": [
              {
                "code": "COUPONCODE",
                "percentage": 50.0
              }
            ]
          }
        }
        ```
        If You want to use existing coupon for discount creation, only ``code`` and optional ``product_family_id`` is
        needed

        ```json
        ...
         "coupons": [
              {
                "code": "FREESETUP",
                "product_family_id": 1
              }
          ]
        ...
        ```

        #### Using Coupon Subcodes You can also use coupon subcodes to apply existing coupons with specific subcodes:

        ```json
        ...
         "coupons": [
              {
                "subcode": "SUB1",
                "product_family_id": 1
              }
          ]
        ...
        ```
        **Important:** You cannot specify both ``code`` and ``subcode`` for the same coupon. Use either:
        - ``code`` to apply a main coupon
        - ``subcode`` to apply a specific coupon subcode

        The API response will include both the main coupon code and the subcode used:

        ```json
        ...
         "coupons": [
              {
                "code": "MAIN123",
                "subcode": "SUB1",
                "product_family_id": 1,
                "percentage": 10,
                "description": "Special discount"
              }
          ]
        ...
        ```

        ### Coupon options #### Code Coupon ``code`` will be displayed on invoice discount section. Coupon code can only
        contain uppercase letters, numbers, and allowed special characters. Lowercase letters will be converted to
        uppercase. It can be used to select an existing coupon from the catalog, or as an ad hoc coupon when passed with
        ``percentage`` or ``amount``. #### Subcode Coupon ``subcode`` allows you to apply existing coupons using their
        subcodes. When a subcode is used, the API response will include both the main coupon code and the specific
        subcode that was applied. Subcodes are case-insensitive and will be converted to uppercase automatically. ####
        Percentage Coupon ``percentage`` can take values from 0 to 100 and up to 4 decimal places. It cannot be used
        with ``amount``. Only for ad hoc coupons, will be ignored if ``code`` is used to select an existing coupon from
        the catalog. #### Amount Coupon ``amount`` takes number value. It cannot be used with ``percentage``. Used only
        when not matching existing coupon by ``code``. #### Description Optional ``description`` will be displayed with
        coupon ``code``. Used only when not matching existing coupon by ``code``. #### Product Family id Optional
        ``product_family_id`` handle (with handle: prefix) or id is used to match existing coupon within site, when
        codes are not unique. #### Compounding Strategy Optional ``compounding_strategy`` for percentage coupons, can
        take values ``compound`` or ``full-price``.

        For amount coupons, discounts will be always calculated against the original item price, before other discounts
        are applied.

        ``compound`` strategy: Percentage-based discounts will be calculated against the remaining price, after prior
        discounts have been calculated. It is set by default.

        ``full-price`` strategy: Percentage-based discounts will always be calculated against the original item price,
        before other discounts are applied.

        ### Line Item Options

        #### Period Date Range

        A custom period date range can be defined for each line item with the ``period_range_start`` and
        ``period_range_end`` parameters. Dates must be sent in the ``YYYY-MM-DD`` format. ``period_range_end`` must be
        greater or equal ``period_range_start``.

        #### Taxes

        The ``taxable`` parameter can be sent as ``true`` if taxes should be calculated for a specific line item. For
        this to work, the site should be configured to use and calculate taxes. Further, if the site uses Avalara for
        tax calculations, a ``tax_code`` parameter should also be sent. For existing catalog items: products/components
        taxes cannot be overwritten.

        #### Price Point Price point handle (with handle: prefix) or id from the scope of current subscription's site
        can be provided with ``price_point_id`` for components with ``component_id`` or ``product_price_point_id`` for
        products with ``product_id`` parameter. If price point is passed ``unit_price`` cannot be used. It can be used
        only with catalog items products and components.

        #### Description Optional ``description`` parameter, it will overwrite default generated description for line
        item.

        ### Invoice Options

        #### Issue Date

        By default, invoices will be created with a issue date set to today in your site's time zone. The ``issue_date``
        parameter can be sent to alter the default. Only today or dates in the past are accepted. This date is
        interpreted and validated in your site's time zone. The format for ``issue_date`` is ``YYYY-MM-DD``.

        #### Net Terms

        By default, invoices will be created with a due date matching the date of invoice creation. If a different due
        date is desired, the ``net_terms`` parameter can be sent indicating the number of days in advance the due date
        should be.

        #### Addresses

        The seller, shipping and billing addresses can be sent to override the site's defaults. Each address requires to
        send a ``first_name`` at a minimum in order to work. See below for the details on which parameters can be sent
        for each address object.

        #### Memo and Payment Instructions

        A custom memo can be sent with the ``memo`` parameter to override the site's default. Likewise, custom payment
        instructions can be sent with the ``payment_instructions`` parameter.

        #### Status

        By default, invoices will be created with open status. Possible alternative is ``draft``.

        You cannot issue a pending child invoice that was created for a member subscription in a group.

        For Remittance subscriptions, the invoice will go into "open" status and payment won't be attempted. The value
        for ``on_failed_payment`` would be rejected if sent. Any prepayments or service credits that exist on the
        subscription will be automatically applied. Additionally, if the setting is enabled, an email will be sent for
        the issued invoice.

        For Automatic subscriptions, prepayments and service credits will apply to the invoice before payment is
        attempted. On successful payment, the invoice will go into "paid" status and email will be sent to the customer
        (if setting applies). When payment fails, the next event depends on the ``on_failed_payment`` value:

            sent to the customer; payment failure recorded in the invoice history.
        - ``initiate_dunning`` - prepayments and credits applied to the invoice; invoice status set to "open"; email
            sent to the customer for the issued invoice (if setting applies); payment failure recorded in the invoice

        + apply_debit_note
        + create_debit_note
        + change_chargeback_status

        Invoice events are returned in ascending order.

        If both a ``since_date`` and ``since_id`` are provided in request parameters, the ``since_date`` will be used.

        Note - invoice events that occurred prior to 09/05/2018 __will not__ contain an ``invoice`` snapshot.

        Args:
            since_date: The timestamp in a format ``YYYY-MM-DD T HH:MM:SS Z``, or ``YYYY-MM-DD``(in this case, it
                returns data from the beginning of the day). of the event from which you want to start the search. All
                the events before the ``since_date`` timestamp are not returned in the response.
            since_id: The ID of the event from which you want to start the search(ID is not included. e.g. if ID is set
                to 2, then all events with ID 3 and more will be shown) This parameter is not used if since_date is
                defined.
            page: Result records are organized in pages. By default, the first page of results is displayed. The page
                parameter specifies a page number of results to fetch. You can start navigating through the pages to
                consume the results. You do this by passing in a page parameter. Retrieve the next page by adding
                ?page=2 to the query string. If there are no results to return, then an empty result set will be
                returned. Use in query ``page=1``.
            per_page: This parameter indicates how many records to fetch in each request. Default value is 100. The
                maximum allowed values is 200; any per_page value over 200 will be changed to 200.
            invoice_uid: Providing an invoice_uid allows for scoping of the invoice events to a single invoice or credit
                note.
            with_change_invoice_status: Use this parameter if you want to fetch also invoice events with
                change_invoice_status type.
            event_types: Filter results by event_type. Supply a comma separated list of event types (listed above). Use
                in query: ``event_types=void_invoice,void_remainder``.
            request_options: Per-call overrides for this one request, such as a timeout or extra headers.

        Returns:
            OK

        error is returned.

        Only the attributes submitted in the request are changed — omitted attributes keep their current values.

        ### Line Items

        The ``line_items`` array describes changes to the invoice's line items. Line items not referenced in the array
        remain unchanged.

        #### Adding a line item

        A line item without a ``uid`` is added to the invoice. The same line item types and options as on invoice
        creation are supported (custom items, ``product_id``, ``component_id``, price points, period date ranges,
        taxes).

        #### Updating a line item

        A line item with the ``uid`` of an existing line item updates that line item with the submitted attributes.
        Amounts and taxes are recalculated.

        #### Removing a line item

        A line item with a ``uid`` and ``"_destroy": true`` is removed from the invoice. Other line items remain
        unchanged.

        Referencing a ``uid`` which does not exist on the invoice returns a ``422`` error.

        ### Coupons

        When the ``coupons`` key is present, the submitted coupons replace all discounts currently applied to the
        invoice. Send an empty array to remove all discounts. Coupon options are the same as on invoice creation.

        ### Invoice Options

        #### Issue Date and Net Terms

        The ``issue_date`` parameter can be sent to change the invoice's issue date. Only today or dates in the past are
        accepted. The date is interpreted and validated in your site's time zone, using the ``YYYY-MM-DD`` format. The
        ``net_terms`` parameter indicates the number of days after the issue date on which the invoice is due. The due
        date is recalculated whenever the issue date or net terms change.

        #### Addresses

        The seller, shipping and billing addresses can be sent to replace the addresses on the invoice. Each address
        requires to send a ``first_name`` at a minimum in order to work. Taxes are recalculated after an address change.

        #### Memo and Payment Instructions

        A custom memo can be sent with the ``memo`` parameter. Likewise, custom payment instructions can be sent with
        the ``payment_instructions`` parameter.

        Args:
            subscription_id: The Chargify id of the subscription.

        request_options: RequestOptionsOrDict | None = None,
    ) -> InvoiceResponse:
        """Creates an ad hoc invoice.

        ### Basic Behavior

        You can create a basic invoice by sending an array of line items to this endpoint. Each line item, at a minimum,
        must include a title, a quantity and a unit price. Example:

        ```json
        {
          "invoice": {
            "line_items": [
              {
                "title": "A Product",
                "quantity": 12,
                "unit_price": "150.00"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
        ```

        ### Catalog items Instead of creating custom products like in above example, You can pass existing items like
        products, components.

        ```json
        {
          "invoice": {
            "line_items": [
              {
                "product_id": "handle:gold-product",
                "quantity": 2,
              }
            ]
          }
        }
        ```


        The price for each line item will be calculated as well as a total due amount for the invoice. Multiple line
        items can be sent.

        ### Line item types When defining a line item, You can choose one of 3 types for a line item: #### Custom item
        As shown in the basic behavior example, You can pass ``title`` and ``unit_price`` for custom item. #### Product
        id Product handle (with handle: prefix) or id from the scope of current subscription's site can be provided with
        ``product_id``. By default ``unit_price`` is taken from product's default price point, but can be overwritten by
        passing ``unit_price`` or ``product_price_point_id``. If ``product_id`` is used, following fields cannot be
        used: ``title``, ``component_id``. #### Component id Component handle (with handle: prefix) or id from the scope
        of current subscription's site can be provided with ``component_id``. If ``component_id`` is used, following
        fields cannot be used: ``title``, ``product_id``. By default ``unit_price`` is taken from product's default
        price point, but can be overwritten by passing ``unit_price`` or ``price_point_id``. At this moment price points
        are supported only for quantity based, on/off and metered components. For prepaid and event based billing
        components ``unit_price`` is required.

        ### Coupons When creating ad hoc invoice, new discounts can be applied in following way:

        ```json
        {
          "invoice": {
            "line_items": [
              {
                "product_id": "handle:gold-product",
                "quantity": 1
              }
            ],
            "coupons": [
              {
                "code": "COUPONCODE",
                "percentage": 50.0
              }
            ]
          }
        }
        ```
        If You want to use existing coupon for discount creation, only ``code`` and optional ``product_family_id`` is
        needed

        ```json
        ...
         "coupons": [
              {
                "code": "FREESETUP",
                "product_family_id": 1
              }
          ]
        ...
        ```

        #### Using Coupon Subcodes You can also use coupon subcodes to apply existing coupons with specific subcodes:

        ```json
        ...
         "coupons": [
              {
                "subcode": "SUB1",
                "product_family_id": 1
              }
          ]
        ...
        ```
        **Important:** You cannot specify both ``code`` and ``subcode`` for the same coupon. Use either:
        - ``code`` to apply a main coupon
        - ``subcode`` to apply a specific coupon subcode

        The API response will include both the main coupon code and the subcode used:

        ```json
        ...
         "coupons": [
              {
                "code": "MAIN123",
                "subcode": "SUB1",
                "product_family_id": 1,
                "percentage": 10,
                "description": "Special discount"
              }
          ]
        ...
        ```

        ### Coupon options #### Code Coupon ``code`` will be displayed on invoice discount section. Coupon code can only
        contain uppercase letters, numbers, and allowed special characters. Lowercase letters will be converted to
        uppercase. It can be used to select an existing coupon from the catalog, or as an ad hoc coupon when passed with
        ``percentage`` or ``amount``. #### Subcode Coupon ``subcode`` allows you to apply existing coupons using their
        subcodes. When a subcode is used, the API response will include both the main coupon code and the specific
        subcode that was applied. Subcodes are case-insensitive and will be converted to uppercase automatically. ####
        Percentage Coupon ``percentage`` can take values from 0 to 100 and up to 4 decimal places. It cannot be used
        with ``amount``. Only for ad hoc coupons, will be ignored if ``code`` is used to select an existing coupon from
        the catalog. #### Amount Coupon ``amount`` takes number value. It cannot be used with ``percentage``. Used only
        when not matching existing coupon by ``code``. #### Description Optional ``description`` will be displayed with
        coupon ``code``. Used only when not matching existing coupon by ``code``. #### Product Family id Optional
        ``product_family_id`` handle (with handle: prefix) or id is used to match existing coupon within site, when
        codes are not unique. #### Compounding Strategy Optional ``compounding_strategy`` for percentage coupons, can
        take values ``compound`` or ``full-price``.

        For amount coupons, discounts will be always calculated against the original item price, before other discounts
        are applied.

        ``compound`` strategy: Percentage-based discounts will be calculated against the remaining price, after prior
        discounts have been calculated. It is set by default.

        ``full-price`` strategy: Percentage-based discounts will always be calculated against the original item price,
        before other discounts are applied.

        ### Line Item Options

        #### Period Date Range

        A custom period date range can be defined for each line item with the ``period_range_start`` and
        ``period_range_end`` parameters. Dates must be sent in the ``YYYY-MM-DD`` format. ``period_range_end`` must be
        greater or equal ``period_range_start``.

        #### Taxes

        The ``taxable`` parameter can be sent as ``true`` if taxes should be calculated for a specific line item. For
        this to work, the site should be configured to use and calculate taxes. Further, if the site uses Avalara for
        tax calculations, a ``tax_code`` parameter should also be sent. For existing catalog items: products/components
        taxes cannot be overwritten.

        #### Price Point Price point handle (with handle: prefix) or id from the scope of current subscription's site
        can be provided with ``price_point_id`` for components with ``component_id`` or ``product_price_point_id`` for
        products with ``product_id`` parameter. If price point is passed ``unit_price`` cannot be used. It can be used
        only with catalog items products and components.

        #### Description Optional ``description`` parameter, it will overwrite default generated description for line
        item.

        ### Invoice Options

        #### Issue Date

        By default, invoices will be created with a issue date set to today in your site's time zone. The ``issue_date``
        parameter can be sent to alter the default. Only today or dates in the past are accepted. This date is
        interpreted and validated in your site's time zone. The format for ``issue_date`` is ``YYYY-MM-DD``.

        #### Net Terms

        By default, invoices will be created with a due date matching the date of invoice creation. If a different due
        date is desired, the ``net_terms`` parameter can be sent indicating the number of days in advance the due date
        should be.

        #### Addresses

        The seller, shipping and billing addresses can be sent to override the site's defaults. Each address requires to
        send a ``first_name`` at a minimum in order to work. See below for the details on which parameters can be sent
        for each address object.

        #### Memo and Payment Instructions

        A custom memo can be sent with the ``memo`` parameter to override the site's default. Likewise, custom payment
        instructions can be sent with the ``payment_instructions`` parameter.

        #### Status

        By default, invoices will be created with open status. Possible alternative is ``draft``.

            subscription_id: The Chargify id of the subscription.

        ### Line Items

        The ``line_items`` array describes changes to the invoice's line items. Line items not referenced in the array
        remain unchanged.

        #### Adding a line item

        A line item without a ``uid`` is added to the invoice. The same line item types and options as on invoice
        creation are supported (custom items, ``product_id``, ``component_id``, price points, period date ranges,
        taxes).

        #### Updating a line item

        A line item with the ``uid`` of an existing line item updates that line item with the submitted attributes.
        Amounts and taxes are recalculated.

        #### Removing a line item

        A line item with a ``uid`` and ``"_destroy": true`` is removed from the invoice. Other line items remain
        unchanged.

        Referencing a ``uid`` which does not exist on the invoice returns a ``422`` error.

        ### Coupons

        When the ``coupons`` key is present, the submitted coupons replace all discounts currently applied to the
        invoice. Send an empty array to remove all discounts. Coupon options are the same as on invoice creation.

        ### Invoice Options

        #### Issue Date and Net Terms

        The ``issue_date`` parameter can be sent to change the invoice's issue date. Only today or dates in the past are
        accepted. The date is interpreted and validated in your site's time zone, using the ``YYYY-MM-DD`` format. The
        ``net_terms`` parameter indicates the number of days after the issue date on which the invoice is due. The due
        date is recalculated whenever the issue date or net terms change.

        #### Addresses

        The seller, shipping and billing addresses can be sent to replace the addresses on the invoice. Each address
        requires to send a ``first_name`` at a minimum in order to work. Taxes are recalculated after an address change.

        #### Memo and Payment Instructions

        A custom memo can be sent with the ``memo`` parameter. Likewise, custom payment instructions can be sent with
        the ``payment_instructions`` parameter.

    def create_invoice(

    ) -> ApiResult[InvoiceResponse, CreateInvoiceErrorBody]:
        """Creates an ad hoc invoice.

        ### Basic Behavior

        You can create a basic invoice by sending an array of line items to this endpoint. Each line item, at a minimum,
        must include a title, a quantity and a unit price. Example:

        ```json
        {
          "invoice": {
            "line_items": [
              {
                "title": "A Product",
                "quantity": 12,
                "unit_price": "150.00"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
        ```

        ### Catalog items Instead of creating custom products like in above example, You can pass existing items like
        products, components.

        ```json
        {
          "invoice": {
            "line_items": [
              {
                "product_id": "handle:gold-product",
                "quantity": 2,
              }
            ]
          }
        }
        ```


        The price for each line item will be calculated as well as a total due amount for the invoice. Multiple line
        items can be sent.

        ### Line item types When defining a line item, You can choose one of 3 types for a line item: #### Custom item
        As shown in the basic behavior example, You can pass ``title`` and ``unit_price`` for custom item. #### Product
        id Product handle (with handle: prefix) or id from the scope of current subscription's site can be provided with
        ``product_id``. By default ``unit_price`` is taken from product's default price point, but can be overwritten by
        passing ``unit_price`` or ``product_price_point_id``. If ``product_id`` is used, following fields cannot be
        used: ``title``, ``component_id``. #### Component id Component handle (with handle: prefix) or id from the scope
        of current subscription's site can be provided with ``component_id``. If ``component_id`` is used, following
        fields cannot be used: ``title``, ``product_id``. By default ``unit_price`` is taken from product's default
        price point, but can be overwritten by passing ``unit_price`` or ``price_point_id``. At this moment price points
        are supported only for quantity based, on/off and metered components. For prepaid and event based billing
        components ``unit_price`` is required.

        ### Coupons When creating ad hoc invoice, new discounts can be applied in following way:

        ```json
        {
          "invoice": {
            "line_items": [
              {
                "product_id": "handle:gold-product",
                "quantity": 1
              }
            ],
            "coupons": [
              {
                "code": "COUPONCODE",
                "percentage": 50.0
              }
            ]
          }
        }
        ```
        If You want to use existing coupon for discount creation, only ``code`` and optional ``product_family_id`` is
        needed

        ```json
        ...
         "coupons": [
              {
                "code": "FREESETUP",
                "product_family_id": 1
              }
          ]
        ...
        ```

        #### Using Coupon Subcodes You can also use coupon subcodes to apply existing coupons with specific subcodes:

        ```json
        ...
         "coupons": [
              {
                "subcode": "SUB1",
                "product_family_id": 1
              }
          ]
        ...
        ```
        **Important:** You cannot specify both ``code`` and ``subcode`` for the same coupon. Use either:
        - ``code`` to apply a main coupon
        - ``subcode`` to apply a specific coupon subcode

        The API response will include both the main coupon code and the subcode used:

        ```json
        ...
         "coupons": [
              {
                "code": "MAIN123",
                "subcode": "SUB1",
                "product_family_id": 1,
                "percentage": 10,
                "description": "Special discount"
              }
          ]
        ...
        ```

        ### Coupon options #### Code Coupon ``code`` will be displayed on invoice discount section. Coupon code can only
        contain uppercase letters, numbers, and allowed special characters. Lowercase letters will be converted to
        uppercase. It can be used to select an existing coupon from the catalog, or as an ad hoc coupon when passed with
        ``percentage`` or ``amount``. #### Subcode Coupon ``subcode`` allows you to apply existing coupons using their
        subcodes. When a subcode is used, the API response will include both the main coupon code and the specific
        subcode that was applied. Subcodes are case-insensitive and will be converted to uppercase automatically. ####
        Percentage Coupon ``percentage`` can take values from 0 to 100 and up to 4 decimal places. It cannot be used
        with ``amount``. Only for ad hoc coupons, will be ignored if ``code`` is used to select an existing coupon from
        the catalog. #### Amount Coupon ``amount`` takes number value. It cannot be used with ``percentage``. Used only
        when not matching existing coupon by ``code``. #### Description Optional ``description`` will be displayed with
        coupon ``code``. Used only when not matching existing coupon by ``code``. #### Product Family id Optional
        ``product_family_id`` handle (with handle: prefix) or id is used to match existing coupon within site, when
        codes are not unique. #### Compounding Strategy Optional ``compounding_strategy`` for percentage coupons, can
        take values ``compound`` or ``full-price``.

        For amount coupons, discounts will be always calculated against the original item price, before other discounts
        are applied.

        ``compound`` strategy: Percentage-based discounts will be calculated against the remaining price, after prior
        discounts have been calculated. It is set by default.

        ``full-price`` strategy: Percentage-based discounts will always be calculated against the original item price,
        before other discounts are applied.

        ### Line Item Options

        #### Period Date Range

        A custom period date range can be defined for each line item with the ``period_range_start`` and
        ``period_range_end`` parameters. Dates must be sent in the ``YYYY-MM-DD`` format. ``period_range_end`` must be
        greater or equal ``period_range_start``.

        #### Taxes

        The ``taxable`` parameter can be sent as ``true`` if taxes should be calculated for a specific line item. For
        this to work, the site should be configured to use and calculate taxes. Further, if the site uses Avalara for
        tax calculations, a ``tax_code`` parameter should also be sent. For existing catalog items: products/components
        taxes cannot be overwritten.

        #### Price Point Price point handle (with handle: prefix) or id from the scope of current subscription's site
        can be provided with ``price_point_id`` for components with ``component_id`` or ``product_price_point_id`` for
        products with ``product_id`` parameter. If price point is passed ``unit_price`` cannot be used. It can be used
        only with catalog items products and components.

        #### Description Optional ``description`` parameter, it will overwrite default generated description for line
        item.

        ### Invoice Options

        #### Issue Date

        By default, invoices will be created with a issue date set to today in your site's time zone. The ``issue_date``
        parameter can be sent to alter the default. Only today or dates in the past are accepted. This date is
        interpreted and validated in your site's time zone. The format for ``issue_date`` is ``YYYY-MM-DD``.

        #### Net Terms

        By default, invoices will be created with a due date matching the date of invoice creation. If a different due
        date is desired, the ``net_terms`` parameter can be sent indicating the number of days in advance the due date
        should be.

        #### Addresses

        The seller, shipping and billing addresses can be sent to override the site's defaults. Each address requires to
        send a ``first_name`` at a minimum in order to work. See below for the details on which parameters can be sent
        for each address object.

        #### Memo and Payment Instructions

        A custom memo can be sent with the ``memo`` parameter to override the site's default. Likewise, custom payment
        instructions can be sent with the ``payment_instructions`` parameter.

        #### Status

        By default, invoices will be created with open status. Possible alternative is ``draft``.

        created when allocating new quantity on a component and using "accrue charges" option.

        You cannot issue a pending child invoice that was created for a member subscription in a group.

        For Remittance subscriptions, the invoice will go into "open" status and payment won't be attempted. The value
        for ``on_failed_payment`` would be rejected if sent. Any prepayments or service credits that exist on the
        subscription will be automatically applied. Additionally, if the setting is enabled, an email will be sent for
        the issued invoice.

        For Automatic subscriptions, prepayments and service credits will apply to the invoice before payment is
        attempted. On successful payment, the invoice will go into "paid" status and email will be sent to the customer
        (if setting applies). When payment fails, the next event depends on the ``on_failed_payment`` value:
        - ``leave_open_invoice`` - prepayments and credits applied to invoice; invoice status set to "open"; email sent
            to the customer for the issued invoice (if setting applies); payment failure recorded in the invoice
            history. This is the default option.
        - ``rollback_to_pending`` - prepayments and credits not applied; invoice remains in "pending" status; no email
            sent to the customer; payment failure recorded in the invoice history.
        - ``initiate_dunning`` - prepayments and credits applied to the invoice; invoice status set to "open"; email
            sent to the customer for the issued invoice (if setting applies); payment failure recorded in the invoice
            history; subscription will most likely go into "past_due" or "canceled" state (depending upon net terms and

        error is returned.

        Only the attributes submitted in the request are changed — omitted attributes keep their current values.

        ### Line Items

        The ``line_items`` array describes changes to the invoice's line items. Line items not referenced in the array
        remain unchanged.

        #### Adding a line item

        A line item without a ``uid`` is added to the invoice. The same line item types and options as on invoice
        creation are supported (custom items, ``product_id``, ``component_id``, price points, period date ranges,
        taxes).

        #### Updating a line item

        A line item with the ``uid`` of an existing line item updates that line item with the submitted attributes.
        Amounts and taxes are recalculated.

        #### Removing a line item

        A line item with a ``uid`` and ``"_destroy": true`` is removed from the invoice. Other line items remain
        unchanged.

        Referencing a ``uid`` which does not exist on the invoice returns a ``422`` error.

        ### Coupons

        When the ``coupons`` key is present, the submitted coupons replace all discounts currently applied to the
        invoice. Send an empty array to remove all discounts. Coupon options are the same as on invoice creation.

        ### Invoice Options

        #### Issue Date and Net Terms

        The ``issue_date`` parameter can be sent to change the invoice's issue date. Only today or dates in the past are
        accepted. The date is interpreted and validated in your site's time zone, using the ``YYYY-MM-DD`` format. The
        ``net_terms`` parameter indicates the number of days after the issue date on which the invoice is due. The due
        date is recalculated whenever the issue date or net terms change.

        #### Addresses

        The seller, shipping and billing addresses can be sent to replace the addresses on the invoice. Each address
        requires to send a ``first_name`` at a minimum in order to work. Taxes are recalculated after an address change.

        #### Memo and Payment Instructions

        A custom memo can be sent with the ``memo`` parameter. Likewise, custom payment instructions can be sent with
        the ``payment_instructions`` parameter.

        """Creates an ad hoc invoice.

        ### Basic Behavior

        You can create a basic invoice by sending an array of line items to this endpoint. Each line item, at a minimum,
        must include a title, a quantity and a unit price. Example:

        ```json
        {
          "invoice": {
            "line_items": [
              {
                "title": "A Product",
                "quantity": 12,
                "unit_price": "150.00"
              }
            ]
          }
        }
        ```

        ### Catalog items Instead of creating custom products like in above example, You can pass existing items like
        products, components.

        ```json
        {
          "invoice": {
            "line_items": [
              {
                "product_id": "handle:gold-product",
                "quantity": 2,
              }
            ]
          }
        }
        ```


        The price for each line item will be calculated as well as a total due amount for the invoice. Multiple line
        items can be sent.

        ### Line item types When defining a line item, You can choose one of 3 types for a line item: #### Custom item
        As shown in the basic behavior example, You can pass ``title`` and ``unit_price`` for custom item. #### Product
        id Product handle (with handle: prefix) or id from the scope of current subscription's site can be provided with
        ``product_id``. By default ``unit_price`` is taken from product's default price point, but can be overwritten by
        passing ``unit_price`` or ``product_price_point_id``. If ``product_id`` is used, following fields cannot be
        used: ``title``, ``component_id``. #### Component id Component handle (with handle: prefix) or id from the scope
        of current subscription's site can be provided with ``component_id``. If ``component_id`` is used, following
        fields cannot be used: ``title``, ``product_id``. By default ``unit_price`` is taken from product's default
        price point, but can be overwritten by passing ``unit_price`` or ``price_point_id``. At this moment price points
        are supported only for quantity based, on/off and metered components. For prepaid and event based billing
        components ``unit_price`` is required.

        ### Coupons When creating ad hoc invoice, new discounts can be applied in following way:

        ```json
        {
          "invoice": {
            "line_items": [
              {
                "product_id": "handle:gold-product",
                "quantity": 1
              }
            ],
            "coupons": [
              {
                "code": "COUPONCODE",
                "percentage": 50.0
              }
            ]
          }
        }
        ```
        If You want to use existing coupon for discount creation, only ``code`` and optional ``product_family_id`` is
        needed

        ```json
        ...
         "coupons": [
              {
                "code": "FREESETUP",
                "product_family_id": 1
              }
          ]
        ...
        ```

        #### Using Coupon Subcodes You can also use coupon subcodes to apply existing coupons with specific subcodes:

        ```json
        ...
         "coupons": [
              {
                "subcode": "SUB1",
                "product_family_id": 1
              }
          ]
        ...
        ```
        **Important:** You cannot specify both ``code`` and ``subcode`` for the same coupon. Use either:
        - ``code`` to apply a main coupon
        - ``subcode`` to apply a specific coupon subcode

        The API response will include both the main coupon code and the subcode used:

        ```json
        ...
         "coupons": [
              {
                "code": "MAIN123",
                "subcode": "SUB1",
                "product_family_id": 1,
                "percentage": 10,
                "description": "Special discount"
              }
          ]
        ...
        ```

        ### Coupon options #### Code Coupon ``code`` will be displayed on invoice discount section. Coupon code can only
        contain uppercase letters, numbers, and allowed special characters. Lowercase letters will be converted to
        uppercase. It can be used to select an existing coupon from the catalog, or as an ad hoc coupon when passed with
        ``percentage`` or ``amount``. #### Subcode Coupon ``subcode`` allows you to apply existing coupons using their
        subcodes. When a subcode is used, the API response will include both the main coupon code and the specific
        subcode that was applied. Subcodes are case-insensitive and will be converted to uppercase automatically. ####
        Percentage Coupon ``percentage`` can take values from 0 to 100 and up to 4 decimal places. It cannot be used
        with ``amount``. Only for ad hoc coupons, will be ignored if ``code`` is used to select an existing coupon from
        the catalog. #### Amount Coupon ``amount`` takes number value. It cannot be used with ``percentage``. Used only
        when not matching existing coupon by ``code``. #### Description Optional ``description`` will be displayed with
        coupon ``code``. Used only when not matching existing coupon by ``code``. #### Product Family id Optional
        ``product_family_id`` handle (with handle: prefix) or id is used to match existing coupon within site, when
        codes are not unique. #### Compounding Strategy Optional ``compounding_strategy`` for percentage coupons, can
        take values ``compound`` or ``full-price``.

        For amount coupons, discounts will be always calculated against the original item price, before other discounts
        are applied.

        ``compound`` strategy: Percentage-based discounts will be calculated against the remaining price, after prior
        discounts have been calculated. It is set by default.

        ``full-price`` strategy: Percentage-based discounts will always be calculated against the original item price,
        before other discounts are applied.

        ### Line Item Options

        #### Period Date Range

        A custom period date range can be defined for each line item with the ``period_range_start`` and
        ``period_range_end`` parameters. Dates must be sent in the ``YYYY-MM-DD`` format. ``period_range_end`` must be
        greater or equal ``period_range_start``.

        #### Taxes

        The ``taxable`` parameter can be sent as ``true`` if taxes should be calculated for a specific line item. For
        this to work, the site should be configured to use and calculate taxes. Further, if the site uses Avalara for
        tax calculations, a ``tax_code`` parameter should also be sent. For existing catalog items: products/components
        taxes cannot be overwritten.

        #### Price Point Price point handle (with handle: prefix) or id from the scope of current subscription's site
        can be provided with ``price_point_id`` for components with ``component_id`` or ``product_price_point_id`` for
        products with ``product_id`` parameter. If price point is passed ``unit_price`` cannot be used. It can be used
        only with catalog items products and components.

        #### Description Optional ``description`` parameter, it will overwrite default generated description for line
        item.

        ### Invoice Options

        #### Issue Date

        By default, invoices will be created with a issue date set to today in your site's time zone. The ``issue_date``
        parameter can be sent to alter the default. Only today or dates in the past are accepted. This date is
        interpreted and validated in your site's time zone. The format for ``issue_date`` is ``YYYY-MM-DD``.

        #### Net Terms

        By default, invoices will be created with a due date matching the date of invoice creation. If a different due
        date is desired, the ``net_terms`` parameter can be sent indicating the number of days in advance the due date
        should be.

        #### Addresses

        The seller, shipping and billing addresses can be sent to override the site's defaults. Each address requires to
        send a ``first_name`` at a minimum in order to work. See below for the details on which parameters can be sent
        for each address object.

        #### Memo and Payment Instructions

        A custom memo can be sent with the ``memo`` parameter to override the site's default. Likewise, custom payment
        instructions can be sent with the ``payment_instructions`` parameter.

        #### Status

        By default, invoices will be created with open status. Possible alternative is ``draft``.

        For Remittance subscriptions, the invoice will go into "open" status and payment won't be attempted. The value
        for ``on_failed_payment`` would be rejected if sent. Any prepayments or service credits that exist on the
        subscription will be automatically applied. Additionally, if the setting is enabled, an email will be sent for

                to 2, then all events with ID 3 and more will be shown) This parameter is not used if since_date is
                defined.
            page: Result records are organized in pages. By default, the first page of results is displayed. The page
                parameter specifies a page number of results to fetch. You can start navigating through the pages to
                consume the results. You do this by passing in a page parameter. Retrieve the next page by adding
                ?page=2 to the query string. If there are no results to return, then an empty result set will be
                returned. Use in query ``page=1``.
            per_page: This parameter indicates how many records to fetch in each request. Default value is 100. The
                maximum allowed values is 200; any per_page value over 200 will be changed to 200.
            invoice_uid: Providing an invoice_uid allows for scoping of the invoice events to a single invoice or credit
                note.
            with_change_invoice_status: Use this parameter if you want to fetch also invoice events with
                change_invoice_status type.
            event_types: Filter results by event_type. Supply a comma separated list of event types (listed above). Use
                in query: ``event_types=void_invoice,void_remainder``.
            request_options: Per-call overrides for this one request, such as a timeout or extra headers.

        **File Attachments**: You can attach files to invoice emails using ``attachment_urls[]`` parameter by providing

        the request returns a ``422`` error. If the invoice does not belong to the provided subscription, a ``404``
        error is returned.

        Only the attributes submitted in the request are changed — omitted attributes keep their current values.

        ### Line Items

        The ``line_items`` array describes changes to the invoice's line items. Line items not referenced in the array
        remain unchanged.

        #### Adding a line item

        A line item without a ``uid`` is added to the invoice. The same line item types and options as on invoice
        creation are supported (custom items, ``product_id``, ``component_id``, price points, period date ranges,
        taxes).

        #### Updating a line item

        A line item with the ``uid`` of an existing line item updates that line item with the submitted attributes.
        Amounts and taxes are recalculated.

        #### Removing a line item

        A line item with a ``uid`` and ``"_destroy": true`` is removed from the invoice. Other line items remain
        unchanged.

        Referencing a ``uid`` which does not exist on the invoice returns a ``422`` error.

        ### Coupons

        When the ``coupons`` key is present, the submitted coupons replace all discounts currently applied to the
        invoice. Send an empty array to remove all discounts. Coupon options are the same as on invoice creation.

        ### Invoice Options

        #### Issue Date and Net Terms

        The ``issue_date`` parameter can be sent to change the invoice's issue date. Only today or dates in the past are
        accepted. The date is interpreted and validated in your site's time zone, using the ``YYYY-MM-DD`` format. The
        ``net_terms`` parameter indicates the number of days after the issue date on which the invoice is due. The due
        date is recalculated whenever the issue date or net terms change.

        #### Addresses

        The seller, shipping and billing addresses can be sent to replace the addresses on the invoice. Each address
        requires to send a ``first_name`` at a minimum in order to work. Taxes are recalculated after an address change.

        #### Memo and Payment Instructions

        A custom memo can be sent with the ``memo`` parameter. Likewise, custom payment instructions can be sent with
        the ``payment_instructions`` parameter.
