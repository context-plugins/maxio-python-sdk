        Additionally, for information on how to record component usage against a subscription, see the following

        It is not possible to record metered usage for more than one component at a time. Usage should be reported as
        one API call per component on a single subscription. For example, to record that a subscriber has sent both an
        SMS Message and an Email, send an API call for each.

        See the following product documentation articles for more information:

        - `Create and Manage Components
            <https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24261149711501-Create-Edit-and-Archive-Components>`__
        - `Recording Metered Component Usage

        - `Reporting Prepaid Component Status
            <https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24251890500109-Reporting-Component-Allocations#reporting-prepaid-component-status>`__

        The ``quantity`` from usage for each component is accumulated to the ``unit_balance`` on the `Component Line
        Item <$e/Subscription%20Components/readSubscriptionComponent>`__ for the subscription.

        ## Price Point ID usage

        If you are using price points, for metered and prepaid usage components Advanced Billing gives you the option to
        specify a price point in your request.

        You do not need to specify a price point ID. If a price point is not included, the default price point for the
        component will be used when the usage is recorded.

        ## Deducting Usage

        If you need to reverse a previous usage report or otherwise deduct from the current usage balance, you can
        provide a negative quantity.

        Example:

        Previously recorded quantity was 5000:

        ```json
        {
          "usage": {
            "quantity": 5000,
            "memo": "Recording 5000 units"
          }
        }
        ```

        To reduce the quantity to ``0``, POST the following payload:

        ```json
        {
          "usage": {
            "quantity": -5000,
            "memo": "Deducting 5000 units"
          }
        }
        ```
        The ``unit_balance`` has a floor of ``0``; negative unit balances are never allowed. For example, if the usage
        balance is 100 and you deduct 200 units, the unit balance would then be ``0``, not ``-100``.

        Args:
            subscription_id_or_reference: Either the Advanced Billing subscription ID (integer) or the subscription
                reference (string). Important: In cases where a numeric string value matches both an existing
                subscription ID and an existing subscription reference, the system will prioritize the subscription ID
                lookup. For example, if both subscription ID 123 and subscription reference "123" exist, passing "123"
                will return the subscription with ID 123.
            component_id: Either the Advanced Billing id for the component or the component's handle prefixed by

                subscription ID and an existing subscription reference, the system will prioritize the subscription ID
                lookup. For example, if both subscription ID 123 and subscription reference "123" exist, passing "123"
                will return the subscription with ID 123.

        It is not possible to record metered usage for more than one component at a time. Usage should be reported as
        one API call per component on a single subscription. For example, to record that a subscriber has sent both an
        SMS Message and an Email, send an API call for each.

        See the following product documentation articles for more information:

        - `Create and Manage Components
            <https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24261149711501-Create-Edit-and-Archive-Components>`__
        - `Recording Metered Component Usage

            <https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24251890500109-Reporting-Component-Allocations#reporting-prepaid-component-status>`__

        The ``quantity`` from usage for each component is accumulated to the ``unit_balance`` on the `Component Line
        Item <$e/Subscription%20Components/readSubscriptionComponent>`__ for the subscription.

        ## Price Point ID usage

        If you are using price points, for metered and prepaid usage components Advanced Billing gives you the option to
        specify a price point in your request.

        You do not need to specify a price point ID. If a price point is not included, the default price point for the
        component will be used when the usage is recorded.

        ## Deducting Usage

        If you need to reverse a previous usage report or otherwise deduct from the current usage balance, you can
        provide a negative quantity.

        Example:

        Previously recorded quantity was 5000:

        ```json
        {
          "usage": {
            "quantity": 5000,
            "memo": "Recording 5000 units"
          }
        }
        ```

        To reduce the quantity to ``0``, POST the following payload:

        ```json
        {
          "usage": {
            "quantity": -5000,
            "memo": "Deducting 5000 units"
          }
        }
        ```
        The ``unit_balance`` has a floor of ``0``; negative unit balances are never allowed. For example, if the usage
        balance is 100 and you deduct 200 units, the unit balance would then be ``0``, not ``-100``.

        Args:
            subscription_id_or_reference: Either the Advanced Billing subscription ID (integer) or the subscription
                reference (string). Important: In cases where a numeric string value matches both an existing
                subscription ID and an existing subscription reference, the system will prioritize the subscription ID
                lookup. For example, if both subscription ID 123 and subscription reference "123" exist, passing "123"
                will return the subscription with ID 123.

            max_id: Returns usages with an id less than or equal to the one specified.
            since_date: Returns usages with a created_at date greater than or equal to midnight (12:00 AM) on the date
                specified.
            until_date: Returns usages with a created_at date less than or equal to midnight (12:00 AM) on the date

        A few limitations exist when changing an allocation's expiration date:

        - An expiration date can only be changed for an allocation that belongs to a price point with expiration
            interval options explicitly set.
        - An expiration date can be changed towards the future with no limitations.
        - An expiration date can be changed towards the past (essentially expiring it) up to the subscription's current
            period beginning date.

        It is not possible to record metered usage for more than one component at a time. Usage should be reported as
        one API call per component on a single subscription. For example, to record that a subscriber has sent both an
        SMS Message and an Email, send an API call for each.

        See the following product documentation articles for more information:

        - `Create and Manage Components
            <https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24261149711501-Create-Edit-and-Archive-Components>`__
        - `Recording Metered Component Usage

            <https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24251890500109-Reporting-Component-Allocations#reporting-prepaid-component-status>`__

        The ``quantity`` from usage for each component is accumulated to the ``unit_balance`` on the `Component Line
        Item <$e/Subscription%20Components/readSubscriptionComponent>`__ for the subscription.

        ## Price Point ID usage

        If you are using price points, for metered and prepaid usage components Advanced Billing gives you the option to
        specify a price point in your request.

        You do not need to specify a price point ID. If a price point is not included, the default price point for the
        component will be used when the usage is recorded.

        ## Deducting Usage

        If you need to reverse a previous usage report or otherwise deduct from the current usage balance, you can
        provide a negative quantity.

        Example:

        Previously recorded quantity was 5000:

        ```json
        {
          "usage": {
            "quantity": 5000,
            "memo": "Recording 5000 units"
          }
        }
        ```

        To reduce the quantity to ``0``, POST the following payload:

        ```json
        {
          "usage": {
            "quantity": -5000,
            "memo": "Deducting 5000 units"
          }
        }
        ```
        The ``unit_balance`` has a floor of ``0``; negative unit balances are never allowed. For example, if the usage
        balance is 100 and you deduct 200 units, the unit balance would then be ``0``, not ``-100``.

        Args:
            subscription_id_or_reference: Either the Advanced Billing subscription ID (integer) or the subscription
                reference (string). Important: In cases where a numeric string value matches both an existing
                subscription ID and an existing subscription reference, the system will prioritize the subscription ID
                lookup. For example, if both subscription ID 123 and subscription reference "123" exist, passing "123"
                will return the subscription with ID 123.

        ## Credit Scheme

        By default, destroying an allocation will generate a service credit on the subscription. This behavior can be
        modified with the optional ``credit_scheme`` parameter on this endpoint. The accepted values are:

        1. ``none``: The allocation will be destroyed and the balances will be updated but no service credit or refund
            will be created.
        2. ``credit``: The allocation will be destroyed and the balances will be updated and a service credit will be
            generated. This is also the default behavior if the ``credit_scheme`` param is not passed.
        3. ``refund``: The allocation will be destroyed and the balances will be updated and a refund will be issued
            along with a Credit Note.

        You can report metered or prepaid usage to Advanced Billing as often as you wish. You can report usage as it

        Full documentation on how to create Components in the Advanced Billing UI can be located `here
        <https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24261149711501-Create-Edit-and-Archive-Components>`__.
        Additionally, for information on how to record component usage against a subscription, see the following
        resources:

        It is not possible to record metered usage for more than one component at a time. Usage should be reported as
        one API call per component on a single subscription. For example, to record that a subscriber has sent both an
        SMS Message and an Email, send an API call for each.

        See the following product documentation articles for more information:

        - `Create and Manage Components
            <https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24261149711501-Create-Edit-and-Archive-Components>`__
        - `Recording Metered Component Usage
            <https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24251890500109-Reporting-Component-Allocations#reporting-metered-component-usage>`__
        - `Reporting Prepaid Component Status
            <https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24251890500109-Reporting-Component-Allocations#reporting-prepaid-component-status>`__

        The ``quantity`` from usage for each component is accumulated to the ``unit_balance`` on the `Component Line
        Item <$e/Subscription%20Components/readSubscriptionComponent>`__ for the subscription.

        ## Price Point ID usage

        If you are using price points, for metered and prepaid usage components Advanced Billing gives you the option to
        specify a price point in your request.

        You do not need to specify a price point ID. If a price point is not included, the default price point for the
        component will be used when the usage is recorded.

        ## Deducting Usage

        If you need to reverse a previous usage report or otherwise deduct from the current usage balance, you can
        provide a negative quantity.

        Example:

        Previously recorded quantity was 5000:

        ```json
        {
          "usage": {
            "quantity": 5000,
            "memo": "Recording 5000 units"
          }
        }
        ```

        To reduce the quantity to ``0``, POST the following payload:

        ```json
        {
          "usage": {
            "quantity": -5000,
            "memo": "Deducting 5000 units"
          }
        }
        ```
        The ``unit_balance`` has a floor of ``0``; negative unit balances are never allowed. For example, if the usage
        balance is 100 and you deduct 200 units, the unit balance would then be ``0``, not ``-100``.

        Args:
            subscription_id_or_reference: Either the Advanced Billing subscription ID (integer) or the subscription
                reference (string). Important: In cases where a numeric string value matches both an existing
                subscription ID and an existing subscription reference, the system will prioritize the subscription ID
                lookup. For example, if both subscription ID 123 and subscription reference "123" exist, passing "123"
                will return the subscription with ID 123.
            component_id: Either the Advanced Billing id for the component or the component's handle prefixed by
                ``handle:``
            body: The request body.
            request_options: Per-call overrides for this one request, such as a timeout, extra headers, or its retry

                ?page=2 to the query string. If there are no results to return, then an empty result set will be
                returned. Use in query ``page=1``.
            per_page: This parameter indicates how many records to fetch in each request. Default value is 20. The
                maximum allowed values is 200; any per_page value over 200 will be changed to 200. Use in query
                ``per_page=200``.
            sort: The attribute by which to sort. Use in query: ``sort=updated_at``.

            start_date: The start date (format YYYY-MM-DD) with which to filter the date_field. Returns components with
                a timestamp at or after midnight (12:00:00 AM) in your site’s time zone on the date specified. Use in
                query ``start_date=2011-12-15``.
            start_datetime: The start date and time (format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS) with which to filter the date_field.
                Returns components with a timestamp at or after exact time provided in query. You can specify timezone
                in query - otherwise your site''s time zone will be used. If provided, this parameter will be used
                instead of start_date. Use in query ``start_datetime=2022-07-01 09:00:05``.

            subscription_ids: Allows fetching components allocation with matching subscription id based on provided ids.
                Use in query ``subscription_ids=1,2,3``.
            price_point_ids: Allows fetching components allocation only if price point id is present. Use in query
                ``price_point_ids=not_null``.
            product_family_ids: Allows fetching components allocation with matching product family id based on provided
                ids. Use in query ``product_family_ids=1,2,3``.

        Note: The ``since_date`` and ``until_date`` attributes each default to midnight on the date specified. For
        example, in order to list usages for January 20th, you would need to append the following to the URL.

        ## Read Usage by Handle

        Use this endpoint to read the previously recorded components for a subscription. You can now specify either the

                subscription ID and an existing subscription reference, the system will prioritize the subscription ID
                lookup. For example, if both subscription ID 123 and subscription reference "123" exist, passing "123"
                will return the subscription with ID 123.
            component_id: Either the Advanced Billing id for the component or the component's handle prefixed by
                ``handle:``

            max_id: Returns usages with an id less than or equal to the one specified.
            since_date: Returns usages with a created_at date greater than or equal to midnight (12:00 AM) on the date
                specified.
            until_date: Returns usages with a created_at date less than or equal to midnight (12:00 AM) on the date
                specified.

        Events-Based Billing is an evolved form of metered billing that is based on data-rich events streamed in

        These events can then be transformed, enriched, or analyzed to form the computed totals of usage charges billed
        to your customers.

        Note: this endpoint differs from the standard URL for this API in that ``events`` and your site subdomain are
