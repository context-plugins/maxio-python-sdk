        Events include various activity that happens around a Site. This information is **especially** useful to track
        down issues that arise when subscriptions are not created due to errors.

        Within the UI, Events are referred to as Site Activity. For more information, see `Site Activity
        <https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24250671733517-Site-Activity>`__.

        Use query string filters to narrow down results. You can use the ``filter`` parameter to filter by event key.

        ### Legacy Filters

        The following keys are no longer supported.

        + ``payment_failure_recreated``
        + ``payment_success_recreated``
        + ``renewal_failure_recreated``
        + ``renewal_success_recreated``
        + ``zferral_revenue_post_failure`` - (Specific to the deprecated Zferral integration)
        + ``zferral_revenue_post_success`` - (Specific to the deprecated Zferral integration)

        ## Event Key The event type is identified by the key property. See `Event Key <$m/Event%20Key>`__ for a complete
        list of supported keys.

        ## Event Specific Data

        Different event types may include additional data in ``event_specific_data`` property. While some events share
        the same schema for ``event_specific_data``, others may not include it at all. For precise mappings from key to
        event_specific_data, refer to `Event <$m/Event>`__.

        ### Example Here’s an example event for the ``subscription_product_change`` event:

        ```
        {
            "event": {
                "id": 351,
                "key": "subscription_product_change",
                "message": "Product changed on Mark Alan's subscription from 'Basic' to 'Pro'",
                "subscription_id": 205,
                "event_specific_data": {
                    "new_product_id": 3,

            }
        }
        ```

        Here’s an example event for the ``subscription_state_change`` event:

        ```
         {
             "event": {
                 "id": 353,

            date_field: The type of filter you would like to apply to your search.
            start_date: The start date (format YYYY-MM-DD) with which to filter the date_field. Returns components with
                a timestamp at or after midnight (12:00:00 AM) in your site’s time zone on the date specified.
            end_date: The end date (format YYYY-MM-DD) with which to filter the date_field. Returns components with a
                timestamp up to and including 11:59:59PM in your site’s time zone on the date specified.
            start_datetime: The start date and time (format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS) with which to filter the date_field.
                Returns components with a timestamp at or after exact time provided in query. You can specify timezone
                in query - otherwise your site's time zone will be used. If provided, this parameter will be used
                instead of start_date.
            end_datetime: The end date and time (format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS) with which to filter the date_field.
                Returns components with a timestamp at or before exact time provided in query. You can specify timezone
                in query - otherwise your site's time zone will be used. If provided, this parameter will be used
                instead of end_date.

        Events include various activity that happens around a Site. This information is **especially** useful to track

        Within the UI, Events are referred to as Site Activity. For more information, see `Site Activity
        <https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24250671733517-Site-Activity>`__.

        Use query string filters to narrow down results. You can use the ``filter`` parameter to filter by event key.

        The following keys are no longer supported.

        + ``payment_failure_recreated``
        + ``payment_success_recreated``
        + ``renewal_failure_recreated``

        ## Event Key The event type is identified by the key property. See `Event Key <$m/Event%20Key>`__ for a complete
        list of supported keys.

        ## Event Specific Data

        Different event types may include additional data in ``event_specific_data`` property. While some events share
        the same schema for ``event_specific_data``, others may not include it at all. For precise mappings from key to
        event_specific_data, refer to `Event <$m/Event>`__.

        ### Example Here’s an example event for the ``subscription_product_change`` event:

        ```
        {
            "event": {
                "id": 351,
                "key": "subscription_product_change",
                "message": "Product changed on Mark Alan's subscription from 'Basic' to 'Pro'",
                "subscription_id": 205,
                "event_specific_data": {
                    "new_product_id": 3,
                    "previous_product_id": 2
                },
                "created_at": "2012-01-30T10:43:31-05:00"
            }
        }
        ```

        Here’s an example event for the ``subscription_state_change`` event:

        ```
         {
             "event": {
                 "id": 353,
                 "key": "subscription_state_change",
                 "message": "State changed on Mark Alan's subscription to Pro from trialing to active",
