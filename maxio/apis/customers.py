        ## Tax and Business Identifiers

        Send ``entity_identifier_kind`` and ``entity_identifier_value`` together to store the customer's tax or business
        identifier, such as an EU VAT number, a French SIREN, or a LEI. A customer holds one identifier at a time.

        The ``vat_eu`` and ``national_tax`` kinds also require ``vat_country``. An unsupported kind, a missing or
        mismatched ``vat_country``, or a ``gln``, ``duns``, or ``lei`` value in the wrong format returns ``422``.

        Always send the kind. ``entity_identifier_value`` on its own is stored as a ``company_reg`` when no
        ``vat_country`` is present, and returns ``422`` naming ``entity_identifier_kind`` when one is.

        A blank pair is ignored rather than rejected, so a ``vat_number`` sent alongside it still takes effect.

        The legacy ``vat_number`` and ``vat_country`` pair still works on its own. When neither entity identifier field
        is sent, Advanced Billing derives the kind from ``vat_country``: an EU member state code or ``GB`` gives
        ``vat_eu``, one of the national tax country codes gives ``national_tax``, and a blank or unrecognized country
        gives ``company_reg``.

        The response reports the stored identifier in ``entity_identifier_kind`` and ``entity_identifier_value``, and
        repeats its value in ``vat_number``.

                returned. Use in query ``page=1``.

                maximum allowed values is 200; any per_page value over 200 will be changed to 200. Use in query
                ``per_page=200``.
            date_field: The type of filter you would like to apply to your search. Use in query:
                ``date_field=created_at``.
            start_date: The start date (format YYYY-MM-DD) with which to filter the date_field. Returns subscriptions
                with a timestamp at or after midnight (12:00:00 AM) in your site’s time zone on the date specified.
            end_date: The end date (format YYYY-MM-DD) with which to filter the date_field. Returns subscriptions with a
                timestamp up to and including 11:59:59PM in your site’s time zone on the date specified.

        ## Tax and Business Identifiers

        Send ``entity_identifier_kind`` and ``entity_identifier_value`` together to store the customer's tax or business
        identifier, such as an EU VAT number, a French SIREN, or a LEI. A customer holds one identifier at a time, so
        saving an identifier of a different kind replaces the existing one.

        The ``vat_eu`` and ``national_tax`` kinds also require ``vat_country``. An unsupported kind, a missing or
        mismatched ``vat_country``, or a ``gln``, ``duns``, or ``lei`` value in the wrong format returns ``422``.

        Always send the kind. ``entity_identifier_value`` on its own is stored as a ``company_reg`` when no
        ``vat_country`` is present, and returns ``422`` naming ``entity_identifier_kind`` when one is.

        To clear an identifier, send a supported ``entity_identifier_kind`` with a blank ``entity_identifier_value``, or
        send a blank ``vat_number`` on its own. The first form also clears ``vat_number`` and ``vat_country``, and it
        removes whichever identifier the customer holds, whatever kind you send with it.

        The legacy ``vat_number`` and ``vat_country`` pair still works on its own. When neither entity identifier field
        is sent, Advanced Billing derives the kind from ``vat_country``: an EU member state code or ``GB`` gives
        ``vat_eu``, one of the national tax country codes gives ``national_tax``, and a blank or unrecognized country
        gives ``company_reg``.

        Sending a customer response straight back leaves the tax ID alone. A blank pair, and a pair that still matches
        the stored identifier with ``vat_country`` unchanged, are read as nothing to change rather than as a request to
        clear. For ``gln``, ``duns``, and ``lei`` that also covers the ``vat_number`` the response mirrors back, so the
        kind survives the round trip.

        What you do change is applied, and the entity identifier fields take precedence over ``vat_number``. A different
        kind or value writes that identifier, and ``vat_number`` and ``vat_country`` follow from it. A different
        ``vat_country`` next to an unchanged pair is a real edit, so it is validated and can return ``422``. Changing
        only ``vat_number`` leaves the pair unchanged, so the derivation above decides the kind, which turns a ``gln``,
        ``duns``, or ``lei`` customer into a ``company_reg``. Setting ``vat_number`` to ``null`` or a blank string still
        clears the identifier.

        The response reports the stored identifier in ``entity_identifier_kind`` and ``entity_identifier_value``, and
        repeats its value in ``vat_number``.

        ## Tax and Business Identifiers

        Send ``entity_identifier_kind`` and ``entity_identifier_value`` together to store the customer's tax or business
        identifier, such as an EU VAT number, a French SIREN, or a LEI. A customer holds one identifier at a time, so
        saving an identifier of a different kind replaces the existing one.

        The ``vat_eu`` and ``national_tax`` kinds also require ``vat_country``. An unsupported kind, a missing or
        mismatched ``vat_country``, or a ``gln``, ``duns``, or ``lei`` value in the wrong format returns ``422``.

        Always send the kind. ``entity_identifier_value`` on its own is stored as a ``company_reg`` when no
        ``vat_country`` is present, and returns ``422`` naming ``entity_identifier_kind`` when one is.

        To clear an identifier, send a supported ``entity_identifier_kind`` with a blank ``entity_identifier_value``, or
        send a blank ``vat_number`` on its own. The first form also clears ``vat_number`` and ``vat_country``, and it
        removes whichever identifier the customer holds, whatever kind you send with it.

        The legacy ``vat_number`` and ``vat_country`` pair still works on its own. When neither entity identifier field
        is sent, Advanced Billing derives the kind from ``vat_country``: an EU member state code or ``GB`` gives
        ``vat_eu``, one of the national tax country codes gives ``national_tax``, and a blank or unrecognized country
        gives ``company_reg``.

        Sending a customer response straight back leaves the tax ID alone. A blank pair, and a pair that still matches
        the stored identifier with ``vat_country`` unchanged, are read as nothing to change rather than as a request to
        clear. For ``gln``, ``duns``, and ``lei`` that also covers the ``vat_number`` the response mirrors back, so the
        kind survives the round trip.

        What you do change is applied, and the entity identifier fields take precedence over ``vat_number``. A different
        kind or value writes that identifier, and ``vat_number`` and ``vat_country`` follow from it. A different
        ``vat_country`` next to an unchanged pair is a real edit, so it is validated and can return ``422``. Changing
        only ``vat_number`` leaves the pair unchanged, so the derivation above decides the kind, which turns a ``gln``,
        ``duns``, or ``lei`` customer into a ``company_reg``. Setting ``vat_number`` to ``null`` or a blank string still
        clears the identifier.

        The response reports the stored identifier in ``entity_identifier_kind`` and ``entity_identifier_value``, and
        repeats its value in ``vat_number``.

        <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1#Current_codes>`__.

        ## Required State Format

        Format the state attribute of the customer using the ISO Standard State codes.

        + US States (two characters): see `ISO 3166-2 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:US>`__.

        + States Outside the US (two to three characters): To find the correct state codes outside the US, go to `ISO

            codes” column next to the country you wish to populate.

        ## Locale

        You can attribute a language/region to the customer to deliver invoices in any required language. For more
        information, see `Customer Locale

        Send ``entity_identifier_kind`` and ``entity_identifier_value`` together to store the customer's tax or business
        identifier, such as an EU VAT number, a French SIREN, or a LEI. A customer holds one identifier at a time.

        The ``vat_eu`` and ``national_tax`` kinds also require ``vat_country``. An unsupported kind, a missing or
        mismatched ``vat_country``, or a ``gln``, ``duns``, or ``lei`` value in the wrong format returns ``422``.

        Always send the kind. ``entity_identifier_value`` on its own is stored as a ``company_reg`` when no
        ``vat_country`` is present, and returns ``422`` naming ``entity_identifier_kind`` when one is.

        A blank pair is ignored rather than rejected, so a ``vat_number`` sent alongside it still takes effect.

        The legacy ``vat_number`` and ``vat_country`` pair still works on its own. When neither entity identifier field
        is sent, Advanced Billing derives the kind from ``vat_country``: an EU member state code or ``GB`` gives

        Send ``entity_identifier_kind`` and ``entity_identifier_value`` together to store the customer's tax or business
        identifier, such as an EU VAT number, a French SIREN, or a LEI. A customer holds one identifier at a time, so
        saving an identifier of a different kind replaces the existing one.

        The ``vat_eu`` and ``national_tax`` kinds also require ``vat_country``. An unsupported kind, a missing or
        mismatched ``vat_country``, or a ``gln``, ``duns``, or ``lei`` value in the wrong format returns ``422``.

        Always send the kind. ``entity_identifier_value`` on its own is stored as a ``company_reg`` when no
        ``vat_country`` is present, and returns ``422`` naming ``entity_identifier_kind`` when one is.

        To clear an identifier, send a supported ``entity_identifier_kind`` with a blank ``entity_identifier_value``, or
        send a blank ``vat_number`` on its own. The first form also clears ``vat_number`` and ``vat_country``, and it
        removes whichever identifier the customer holds, whatever kind you send with it.

        The legacy ``vat_number`` and ``vat_country`` pair still works on its own. When neither entity identifier field
        is sent, Advanced Billing derives the kind from ``vat_country``: an EU member state code or ``GB`` gives
        ``vat_eu``, one of the national tax country codes gives ``national_tax``, and a blank or unrecognized country
        gives ``company_reg``.

        Sending a customer response straight back leaves the tax ID alone. A blank pair, and a pair that still matches
        the stored identifier with ``vat_country`` unchanged, are read as nothing to change rather than as a request to
        clear. For ``gln``, ``duns``, and ``lei`` that also covers the ``vat_number`` the response mirrors back, so the
        kind survives the round trip.

        What you do change is applied, and the entity identifier fields take precedence over ``vat_number``. A different
        kind or value writes that identifier, and ``vat_number`` and ``vat_country`` follow from it. A different
        ``vat_country`` next to an unchanged pair is a real edit, so it is validated and can return ``422``. Changing
        only ``vat_number`` leaves the pair unchanged, so the derivation above decides the kind, which turns a ``gln``,
        ``duns``, or ``lei`` customer into a ``company_reg``. Setting ``vat_number`` to ``null`` or a blank string still
        clears the identifier.

        The response reports the stored identifier in ``entity_identifier_kind`` and ``entity_identifier_value``, and
        repeats its value in ``vat_number``.

        + Search by an Advanced Billing ID
        + Search by an organization
        + Search by a reference value from your application

                ?page=2 to the query string. If there are no results to return, then an empty result set will be
                returned. Use in query ``page=1``.
            per_page: This parameter indicates how many records to fetch in each request. Default value is 50. The
                maximum allowed values is 200; any per_page value over 200 will be changed to 200. Use in query
                ``per_page=200``.
            date_field: The type of filter you would like to apply to your search. Use in query:
                ``date_field=created_at``.
            start_date: The start date (format YYYY-MM-DD) with which to filter the date_field. Returns subscriptions
                with a timestamp at or after midnight (12:00:00 AM) in your site’s time zone on the date specified.
            end_date: The end date (format YYYY-MM-DD) with which to filter the date_field. Returns subscriptions with a
                timestamp up to and including 11:59:59PM in your site’s time zone on the date specified.
            start_datetime: The start date and time (format YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS) with which to filter the date_field.
                Returns subscriptions with a timestamp at or after exact time provided in query. You can specify
