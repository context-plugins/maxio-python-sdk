        The "Next Billing" amount and "Next Billing" date are already represented in the UI on each Subscriber's
        Summary. For more information, see `Subscriber Interface Overview
        <https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24252493695757-Subscriber-Interface-Overview>`__.

        ## Optional Component Fields

        This endpoint is particularly useful because it returns the computed billing amount for the base product and the
        components which are in use by a subscriber.

        By default, the preview includes billing details for all components _at their **current** quantities_. This
        means:

        * Current ``allocated_quantity`` for quantity-based components
        * Current enabled/disabled status for on/off components
        * Current metered usage ``unit_balance`` for metered components
        * Current metric quantity value for events recorded thus far for events-based components

        In the above statements, "current" means the quantity or value as of the call to the renewal preview endpoint.
        End-of-period values for components are not predicted, so metered or events-based usage may be less than it will
        eventually be at the end of the period.

        Optionally, **you can provide your own custom quantities** for any component to see a billing preview for
        non-current quantities. This is accomplished by sending a request body with data under the ``components`` key.
        See the request body documentation below.

        ## Preview Behavior

        Sending a ``POST`` request to this endpoint returns preview data without modifying the subscription. This method
        previews data, but does not log any changes against a subscription.

        Args:
            subscription_id: The Chargify id of the subscription.

                count and statuses.

        Returns:
            OK

        Raises:
            ApiError: Unprocessable Entity (WebDAV) ``error`` is ``ErrorListResponse1 | RawError``."""

        """Reactivates a previously canceled subscription. For details on how the reactivation works, and how to

        **Note: The term "resume" is used also during another process in Advanced Billing. This occurs when an on-hold
        subscription is "resumed". This returns the subscription to an active state.**

        + The response returns the subscription object in the ``active`` or ``trialing`` state.
        + The ``canceled_at`` and ``cancellation_message`` fields do not have values.
        + The method works for "Canceled" or "Trial Ended" subscriptions.
        + It will not work for items not marked as "Canceled", "Unpaid", or "Trial Ended".

        ## Resume the current billing period for a subscription

        A subscription is considered "resumable" if you are attempting to reactivate within the billing period the
        subscription was canceled in.

        A resumed subscription's billing date remains the same as before it was canceled. In other words, it does not
        start a new billing period. Payment may or may not be collected for a resumed subscription, depending on whether
        or not the subscription had a balance when it was canceled (for example, if it was canceled because of dunning).

        Consider a subscription which was created on June 1st, and would renew on July 1st. The subscription is then
        canceled on June 15.

        If a reactivation with ``resume: true`` were attempted _before_ what would have been the next billing date of
        July 1st, then Advanced Billing would resume the subscription.

        If a reactivation with ``resume: true`` were attempted _after_ what would have been the next billing date of
        July 1st, then Advanced Billing would not resume the subscription, and instead it would be reactivated with a
        new billing period.

        If a reactivation with ``resume: false``, or where 'resume' is omitted were attempted, then Advanced Billing
        would reactivate the subscription with a new billing period regardless of whether or not resuming the previous
        billing period was possible.

        | Canceled | Reactivation | Resumable? |
        |---|---|---|
        | Jun 15 | June 28 | Yes |
        | Jun 15 | July 2 | No |

        ## Reactivation Scenarios

        ### Reactivating Canceled Subscription While Preserving Balance

        + Given you have a product that costs $20
        + Given you have a canceled subscription to the $20 product
            + 1 charge should exist for $20
            + 1 payment should exist for $20
        + When the subscription has canceled due to dunning, it retained a negative balance of $20

        #### Results

        The resulting charges upon reactivation will be:
        + 1 charge for $20 for the new product
        + 1 charge for $20 for the balance due
        + Total charges = $40

        + The subscription will transition to active
        + The subscription balance will be zero

        ### Reactivating a Canceled Subscription With Coupon

        + Given you have a canceled subscription
        + It has no current period defined
        + You have a coupon code "EARLYBIRD"
        + The coupon is set to recur for 6 periods

        PUT request sent to:
        ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?coupon_code=EARLYBIRD``

        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to active
        + The subscription should have applied a coupon with code "EARLYBIRD"

        ### Reactivating Canceled Subscription With a Trial, Without the include_trial Flag

        + Given you have a canceled subscription
        + The product associated with the subscription has a trial

        + PUT request to
        ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json``


        #### Results
        + The subscription will transition to active

        ### Reactivating Canceled Subscription With Trial, With the include_trial Flag

        + Given you have a canceled subscription
        + The product associated with the subscription has a trial

        + Send a PUT request to
            ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?include_trial=1``


        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to trialing

        ### Reactivating Trial Ended Subscription

        + Given you have a trial_ended subscription
        + Send a PUT request to ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json``

        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to active

        ### Resuming a Canceled Subscription

        + Given you have a ``canceled`` subscription and it is resumable
        + Send a PUT request to
            ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?resume=true``

        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to active
        + The next billing date should not have changed

        ### Attempting to resume a subscription which is not resumable

        + Given you have a ``canceled`` subscription, and it is not resumable
        + Send a PUT request to
            ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?resume=true``

        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to active, with a new billing period.

        ### Attempting to resume but not reactivate a subscription which is not resumable

        + Given you have a ``canceled`` subscription, and it is not resumable
        + Send a PUT request to
            ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?resume[require_resume]=true``
        + The response status should be "422 UNPROCESSABLE ENTITY"
        + The subscription should be canceled with the following response
        ```
          {
            "errors": ["Request was 'resume only', but this subscription cannot be resumed."]
          }
        ```

        #### Results

        + The subscription should remain ``canceled``
        + The next billing date should not have changed

        ### Resuming Subscription Which Was Trialing

        + Given you have a ``trial_ended`` subscription, and it is resumable
        + And the subscription was canceled in the middle of a trial
        + And there is still time left on the trial
        + Send a PUT request to
            ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?resume=true``

        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to trialing
        + The next billing date should not have changed

        ### Resuming Subscription Which Was trial_ended

        + Given you have a ``trial_ended`` subscription, and it is resumable
        + Send a PUT request to
            ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?resume=true``

        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to active
        + The next billing date should not have changed
        + Any product-related charges should have been collected

        The "Next Billing" amount and "Next Billing" date are already represented in the UI on each Subscriber's
        Summary. For more information, see `Subscriber Interface Overview
        <https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24252493695757-Subscriber-Interface-Overview>`__.

        ## Optional Component Fields

        This endpoint is particularly useful because it returns the computed billing amount for the base product and the
        components which are in use by a subscriber.

        By default, the preview includes billing details for all components _at their **current** quantities_. This
        means:

        * Current ``allocated_quantity`` for quantity-based components
        * Current enabled/disabled status for on/off components
        * Current metered usage ``unit_balance`` for metered components
        * Current metric quantity value for events recorded thus far for events-based components

        In the above statements, "current" means the quantity or value as of the call to the renewal preview endpoint.
        End-of-period values for components are not predicted, so metered or events-based usage may be less than it will
        eventually be at the end of the period.

        Optionally, **you can provide your own custom quantities** for any component to see a billing preview for
        non-current quantities. This is accomplished by sending a request body with data under the ``components`` key.
        See the request body documentation below.

        ## Preview Behavior

        Sending a ``POST`` request to this endpoint returns preview data without modifying the subscription. This method
        previews data, but does not log any changes against a subscription.

        Args:
            subscription_id: The Chargify id of the subscription.

        **Note: The term "resume" is used also during another process in Advanced Billing. This occurs when an on-hold
        subscription is "resumed". This returns the subscription to an active state.**

        + The response returns the subscription object in the ``active`` or ``trialing`` state.
        + The ``canceled_at`` and ``cancellation_message`` fields do not have values.
        + The method works for "Canceled" or "Trial Ended" subscriptions.
        + It will not work for items not marked as "Canceled", "Unpaid", or "Trial Ended".

        ## Resume the current billing period for a subscription

        A subscription is considered "resumable" if you are attempting to reactivate within the billing period the
        subscription was canceled in.

        A resumed subscription's billing date remains the same as before it was canceled. In other words, it does not
        start a new billing period. Payment may or may not be collected for a resumed subscription, depending on whether
        or not the subscription had a balance when it was canceled (for example, if it was canceled because of dunning).

        Consider a subscription which was created on June 1st, and would renew on July 1st. The subscription is then
        canceled on June 15.

        If a reactivation with ``resume: true`` were attempted _before_ what would have been the next billing date of
        July 1st, then Advanced Billing would resume the subscription.

        If a reactivation with ``resume: true`` were attempted _after_ what would have been the next billing date of
        July 1st, then Advanced Billing would not resume the subscription, and instead it would be reactivated with a
        new billing period.

        If a reactivation with ``resume: false``, or where 'resume' is omitted were attempted, then Advanced Billing
        would reactivate the subscription with a new billing period regardless of whether or not resuming the previous
        billing period was possible.

        | Canceled | Reactivation | Resumable? |
        |---|---|---|
        | Jun 15 | June 28 | Yes |
        | Jun 15 | July 2 | No |

        ## Reactivation Scenarios

        ### Reactivating Canceled Subscription While Preserving Balance

        + Given you have a product that costs $20
        + Given you have a canceled subscription to the $20 product
            + 1 charge should exist for $20
            + 1 payment should exist for $20
        + When the subscription has canceled due to dunning, it retained a negative balance of $20

        #### Results

        The resulting charges upon reactivation will be:
        + 1 charge for $20 for the new product
        + 1 charge for $20 for the balance due
        + Total charges = $40

        + The subscription will transition to active
        + The subscription balance will be zero

        ### Reactivating a Canceled Subscription With Coupon

        + Given you have a canceled subscription
        + It has no current period defined
        + You have a coupon code "EARLYBIRD"
        + The coupon is set to recur for 6 periods

        PUT request sent to:
        ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?coupon_code=EARLYBIRD``

        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to active
        + The subscription should have applied a coupon with code "EARLYBIRD"

        ### Reactivating Canceled Subscription With a Trial, Without the include_trial Flag

        + Given you have a canceled subscription
        + The product associated with the subscription has a trial

        + PUT request to
        ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json``


        #### Results
        + The subscription will transition to active

        ### Reactivating Canceled Subscription With Trial, With the include_trial Flag

        + Given you have a canceled subscription
        + The product associated with the subscription has a trial

        + Send a PUT request to
            ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?include_trial=1``


        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to trialing

        ### Reactivating Trial Ended Subscription

        + Given you have a trial_ended subscription
        + Send a PUT request to ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json``

        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to active

        ### Resuming a Canceled Subscription

        + Given you have a ``canceled`` subscription and it is resumable
        + Send a PUT request to
            ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?resume=true``

        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to active
        + The next billing date should not have changed

        ### Attempting to resume a subscription which is not resumable

        + Given you have a ``canceled`` subscription, and it is not resumable
        + Send a PUT request to
            ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?resume=true``

        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to active, with a new billing period.

        ### Attempting to resume but not reactivate a subscription which is not resumable

        + Given you have a ``canceled`` subscription, and it is not resumable
        + Send a PUT request to
            ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?resume[require_resume]=true``
        + The response status should be "422 UNPROCESSABLE ENTITY"
        + The subscription should be canceled with the following response
        ```
          {
            "errors": ["Request was 'resume only', but this subscription cannot be resumed."]
          }
        ```

        #### Results

        + The subscription should remain ``canceled``
        + The next billing date should not have changed

        ### Resuming Subscription Which Was Trialing

        + Given you have a ``trial_ended`` subscription, and it is resumable
        + And the subscription was canceled in the middle of a trial
        + And there is still time left on the trial
        + Send a PUT request to
            ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?resume=true``

        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to trialing
        + The next billing date should not have changed

        ### Resuming Subscription Which Was trial_ended

        + Given you have a ``trial_ended`` subscription, and it is resumable
        + Send a PUT request to
            ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?resume=true``

        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to active
        + The next billing date should not have changed
        + Any product-related charges should have been collected

        The "Next Billing" amount and "Next Billing" date are already represented in the UI on each Subscriber's
        Summary. For more information, see `Subscriber Interface Overview
        <https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24252493695757-Subscriber-Interface-Overview>`__.

        ## Optional Component Fields

        This endpoint is particularly useful because it returns the computed billing amount for the base product and the
        components which are in use by a subscriber.

        By default, the preview includes billing details for all components _at their **current** quantities_. This
        means:

        * Current ``allocated_quantity`` for quantity-based components
        * Current enabled/disabled status for on/off components
        * Current metered usage ``unit_balance`` for metered components
        * Current metric quantity value for events recorded thus far for events-based components

        In the above statements, "current" means the quantity or value as of the call to the renewal preview endpoint.
        End-of-period values for components are not predicted, so metered or events-based usage may be less than it will
        eventually be at the end of the period.

        Optionally, **you can provide your own custom quantities** for any component to see a billing preview for
        non-current quantities. This is accomplished by sending a request body with data under the ``components`` key.
        See the request body documentation below.

        ## Preview Behavior

        Sending a ``POST`` request to this endpoint returns preview data without modifying the subscription. This method
        previews data, but does not log any changes against a subscription.

        + The method works for "Canceled" or "Trial Ended" subscriptions.
        + It will not work for items not marked as "Canceled", "Unpaid", or "Trial Ended".

        ## Resume the current billing period for a subscription

        A subscription is considered "resumable" if you are attempting to reactivate within the billing period the
        subscription was canceled in.

        A resumed subscription's billing date remains the same as before it was canceled. In other words, it does not
        start a new billing period. Payment may or may not be collected for a resumed subscription, depending on whether
        or not the subscription had a balance when it was canceled (for example, if it was canceled because of dunning).

        Consider a subscription which was created on June 1st, and would renew on July 1st. The subscription is then
        canceled on June 15.

        If a reactivation with ``resume: true`` were attempted _before_ what would have been the next billing date of
        July 1st, then Advanced Billing would resume the subscription.

        If a reactivation with ``resume: true`` were attempted _after_ what would have been the next billing date of
        July 1st, then Advanced Billing would not resume the subscription, and instead it would be reactivated with a
        new billing period.

        If a reactivation with ``resume: false``, or where 'resume' is omitted were attempted, then Advanced Billing
        would reactivate the subscription with a new billing period regardless of whether or not resuming the previous
        billing period was possible.

        | Canceled | Reactivation | Resumable? |
        |---|---|---|
        | Jun 15 | June 28 | Yes |
        | Jun 15 | July 2 | No |

        ## Reactivation Scenarios

        ### Reactivating Canceled Subscription While Preserving Balance

        + Given you have a product that costs $20
        + Given you have a canceled subscription to the $20 product
            + 1 charge should exist for $20
            + 1 payment should exist for $20
        + When the subscription has canceled due to dunning, it retained a negative balance of $20

        #### Results

        The resulting charges upon reactivation will be:
        + 1 charge for $20 for the new product
        + 1 charge for $20 for the balance due
        + Total charges = $40

        + The subscription will transition to active
        + The subscription balance will be zero

        ### Reactivating a Canceled Subscription With Coupon

        + Given you have a canceled subscription
        + It has no current period defined
        + You have a coupon code "EARLYBIRD"
        + The coupon is set to recur for 6 periods

        PUT request sent to:
        ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?coupon_code=EARLYBIRD``

        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to active
        + The subscription should have applied a coupon with code "EARLYBIRD"

        ### Reactivating Canceled Subscription With a Trial, Without the include_trial Flag

        + Given you have a canceled subscription
        + The product associated with the subscription has a trial

        + PUT request to
        ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json``


        #### Results
        + The subscription will transition to active

        ### Reactivating Canceled Subscription With Trial, With the include_trial Flag

        + Given you have a canceled subscription
        + The product associated with the subscription has a trial

        + Send a PUT request to
            ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?include_trial=1``


        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to trialing

        ### Reactivating Trial Ended Subscription

        + Given you have a trial_ended subscription
        + Send a PUT request to ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json``

        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to active

        ### Resuming a Canceled Subscription

        + Given you have a ``canceled`` subscription and it is resumable
        + Send a PUT request to
            ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?resume=true``

        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to active
        + The next billing date should not have changed

        ### Attempting to resume a subscription which is not resumable

        + Given you have a ``canceled`` subscription, and it is not resumable
        + Send a PUT request to
            ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?resume=true``

        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to active, with a new billing period.

        ### Attempting to resume but not reactivate a subscription which is not resumable

        + Given you have a ``canceled`` subscription, and it is not resumable
        + Send a PUT request to
            ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?resume[require_resume]=true``
        + The response status should be "422 UNPROCESSABLE ENTITY"
        + The subscription should be canceled with the following response
        ```
          {
            "errors": ["Request was 'resume only', but this subscription cannot be resumed."]
          }
        ```

        #### Results

        + The subscription should remain ``canceled``
        + The next billing date should not have changed

        ### Resuming Subscription Which Was Trialing

        + Given you have a ``trial_ended`` subscription, and it is resumable
        + And the subscription was canceled in the middle of a trial
        + And there is still time left on the trial
        + Send a PUT request to
            ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?resume=true``

        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to trialing
        + The next billing date should not have changed

        ### Resuming Subscription Which Was trial_ended

        + Given you have a ``trial_ended`` subscription, and it is resumable
        + Send a PUT request to
            ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?resume=true``

        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to active
        + The next billing date should not have changed
        + Any product-related charges should have been collected

        The "Next Billing" amount and "Next Billing" date are already represented in the UI on each Subscriber's

        ## Optional Component Fields

        This endpoint is particularly useful because it returns the computed billing amount for the base product and the
        components which are in use by a subscriber.

        By default, the preview includes billing details for all components _at their **current** quantities_. This
        means:

        * Current ``allocated_quantity`` for quantity-based components
        * Current enabled/disabled status for on/off components
        * Current metered usage ``unit_balance`` for metered components
        * Current metric quantity value for events recorded thus far for events-based components

        In the above statements, "current" means the quantity or value as of the call to the renewal preview endpoint.
        End-of-period values for components are not predicted, so metered or events-based usage may be less than it will
        eventually be at the end of the period.

        Optionally, **you can provide your own custom quantities** for any component to see a billing preview for
        non-current quantities. This is accomplished by sending a request body with data under the ``components`` key.
        See the request body documentation below.

        ## Preview Behavior

        Sending a ``POST`` request to this endpoint returns preview data without modifying the subscription. This method
        previews data, but does not log any changes against a subscription.

        + The ``canceled_at`` and ``cancellation_message`` fields do not have values.
        + The method works for "Canceled" or "Trial Ended" subscriptions.
        + It will not work for items not marked as "Canceled", "Unpaid", or "Trial Ended".

        ## Resume the current billing period for a subscription

        A subscription is considered "resumable" if you are attempting to reactivate within the billing period the
        subscription was canceled in.

        A resumed subscription's billing date remains the same as before it was canceled. In other words, it does not
        start a new billing period. Payment may or may not be collected for a resumed subscription, depending on whether
        or not the subscription had a balance when it was canceled (for example, if it was canceled because of dunning).

        Consider a subscription which was created on June 1st, and would renew on July 1st. The subscription is then
        canceled on June 15.

        If a reactivation with ``resume: true`` were attempted _before_ what would have been the next billing date of
        July 1st, then Advanced Billing would resume the subscription.

        If a reactivation with ``resume: true`` were attempted _after_ what would have been the next billing date of
        July 1st, then Advanced Billing would not resume the subscription, and instead it would be reactivated with a
        new billing period.

        If a reactivation with ``resume: false``, or where 'resume' is omitted were attempted, then Advanced Billing
        would reactivate the subscription with a new billing period regardless of whether or not resuming the previous
        billing period was possible.

        | Canceled | Reactivation | Resumable? |
        |---|---|---|
        | Jun 15 | June 28 | Yes |
        | Jun 15 | July 2 | No |

        ## Reactivation Scenarios

        ### Reactivating Canceled Subscription While Preserving Balance

        + Given you have a product that costs $20
        + Given you have a canceled subscription to the $20 product
            + 1 charge should exist for $20
            + 1 payment should exist for $20
        + When the subscription has canceled due to dunning, it retained a negative balance of $20

        #### Results

        The resulting charges upon reactivation will be:
        + 1 charge for $20 for the new product
        + 1 charge for $20 for the balance due
        + Total charges = $40

        + The subscription will transition to active
        + The subscription balance will be zero

        ### Reactivating a Canceled Subscription With Coupon

        + Given you have a canceled subscription
        + It has no current period defined
        + You have a coupon code "EARLYBIRD"
        + The coupon is set to recur for 6 periods

        PUT request sent to:
        ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?coupon_code=EARLYBIRD``

        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to active
        + The subscription should have applied a coupon with code "EARLYBIRD"

        ### Reactivating Canceled Subscription With a Trial, Without the include_trial Flag

        + Given you have a canceled subscription
        + The product associated with the subscription has a trial

        + PUT request to
        ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json``


        #### Results
        + The subscription will transition to active

        ### Reactivating Canceled Subscription With Trial, With the include_trial Flag

        + Given you have a canceled subscription
        + The product associated with the subscription has a trial

        + Send a PUT request to
            ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?include_trial=1``


        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to trialing

        ### Reactivating Trial Ended Subscription

        + Given you have a trial_ended subscription
        + Send a PUT request to ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json``

        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to active

        ### Resuming a Canceled Subscription

        + Given you have a ``canceled`` subscription and it is resumable
        + Send a PUT request to
            ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?resume=true``

        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to active
        + The next billing date should not have changed

        ### Attempting to resume a subscription which is not resumable

        + Given you have a ``canceled`` subscription, and it is not resumable
        + Send a PUT request to
            ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?resume=true``

        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to active, with a new billing period.

        ### Attempting to resume but not reactivate a subscription which is not resumable

        + Given you have a ``canceled`` subscription, and it is not resumable
        + Send a PUT request to
            ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?resume[require_resume]=true``
        + The response status should be "422 UNPROCESSABLE ENTITY"
        + The subscription should be canceled with the following response
        ```
          {
            "errors": ["Request was 'resume only', but this subscription cannot be resumed."]
          }
        ```

        #### Results

        + The subscription should remain ``canceled``
        + The next billing date should not have changed

        ### Resuming Subscription Which Was Trialing

        + Given you have a ``trial_ended`` subscription, and it is resumable
        + And the subscription was canceled in the middle of a trial
        + And there is still time left on the trial
        + Send a PUT request to
            ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?resume=true``

        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to trialing
        + The next billing date should not have changed

        ### Resuming Subscription Which Was trial_ended

        + Given you have a ``trial_ended`` subscription, and it is resumable
        + Send a PUT request to
            ``https://acme.chargify.com/subscriptions/{subscription_id}/reactivate.json?resume=true``

        #### Results

        + The subscription will transition to active
        + The next billing date should not have changed
        + Any product-related charges should have been collected

        ## 3D Secure (3DS) Authentication post-authentication flow

        When a payment requires 3DS Authentication to adhere to Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), the request enters
        a post-authentication flow where a 422 Unprocessable Entity status is returned with an action_link that will
        direct the customer through 3DS Authentication.

        See the `3D Secure Post-Authentication Flow
        <https://docs.maxio.com/hc/en-us/articles/44277749524365-3D-Secure-Post-Authentication-Flow>`__ article in the
        product documentation to learn how to manage the redirect flow.

        When a payment requires 3DS Authentication to adhere to Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), the request enters
        a post-authentication flow where a 422 Unprocessable Entity status is returned with an action_link that will
        direct the customer through 3DS Authentication.

        <https://docs.maxio.com/hc/en-us/articles/44277749524365-3D-Secure-Post-Authentication-Flow>`__ article in the
        product documentation to learn how to manage the redirect flow.
