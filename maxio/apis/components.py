        Event-based components are similar to other component types, in that you define the component parameters (such
        as name and taxability) and the pricing. A key difference for the event-based component is that it must be
        attached to a metric. This is because the metric provides the component with the actual quantity used in
        computing what and how much will be billed each period for each subscription.

        So, instead of reporting usage directly for each component (as you would with metered components), the usage is
        derived from analysis of your events.

        Metered components are used to bill for any type of unit that resets to 0 at the end of the billing period
        (think daily Google Ads clicks or monthly cell phone minutes). This is most commonly associated with usage-based
        billing and many other pricing schemes.

        Note that this is different from recurring quantity-based components, which DO NOT reset to zero at the start of
        every billing period. If you want to bill for a quantity of something that does not change unless you change it,
        then you want quantity components, instead.

        #### Hybrid Pricing A ``volume``, ``tiered``, or ``stairstep`` metered component can combine its primary pricing
        with a secondary pricing model (the ``overage_pricing`` parameter) so both bill as a single invoice line item
        instead of two. This does not apply to metered components configured for event-based billing (metric, meter, or
        formula). See `Hybrid Pricing <page:introduction/basic-concepts/hybrid-pricing>`__ for requirements and
        configuration details.

        quantity-based components are used to bill for the number of some unit (think monthly software user licenses or

        licenses, number of users, number of employees, etc.

        example, at the time of signup, you might want to charge your customer a one-time fee for onboarding or other
        services.

        Event-based components are similar to other component types, in that you define the component parameters (such
        as name and taxability) and the pricing. A key difference for the event-based component is that it must be
        attached to a metric. This is because the metric provides the component with the actual quantity used in
        computing what and how much will be billed each period for each subscription.

        So, instead of reporting usage directly for each component (as you would with metered components), the usage is

        billing and many other pricing schemes.

        every billing period. If you want to bill for a quantity of something that does not change unless you change it,
        then you want quantity components, instead.

        #### Hybrid Pricing A ``volume``, ``tiered``, or ``stairstep`` metered component can combine its primary pricing
        with a secondary pricing model (the ``overage_pricing`` parameter) so both bill as a single invoice line item

                consume the results. You do this by passing in a page parameter. Retrieve the next page by adding

                returned. Use in query ``page=1``.
            per_page: This parameter indicates how many records to fetch in each request. Default value is 20. The
                maximum allowed values is 200; any per_page value over 200 will be changed to 200. Use in query

        (think daily Google Ads clicks or monthly cell phone minutes). This is most commonly associated with usage-based
        billing and many other pricing schemes.

        Note that this is different from recurring quantity-based components, which DO NOT reset to zero at the start of
        every billing period. If you want to bill for a quantity of something that does not change unless you change it,
        then you want quantity components, instead.

        #### Hybrid Pricing A ``volume``, ``tiered``, or ``stairstep`` metered component can combine its primary pricing
        with a secondary pricing model (the ``overage_pricing`` parameter) so both bill as a single invoice line item

        ``volume``, ``tiered``, or ``stairstep`` component can combine its primary pricing with a secondary pricing
        model (the ``overage_pricing`` parameter) so both bill as a single invoice line item instead of two. See `Hybrid
        Pricing <page:introduction/basic-concepts/hybrid-pricing>`__ for requirements and configuration details.

        Metered components are used to bill for any type of unit that resets to 0 at the end of the billing period

        billing and many other pricing schemes.

        every billing period. If you want to bill for a quantity of something that does not change unless you change it,
        then you want quantity components, instead.

        #### Hybrid Pricing A ``volume``, ``tiered``, or ``stairstep`` metered component can combine its primary pricing
        with a secondary pricing model (the ``overage_pricing`` parameter) so both bill as a single invoice line item
        instead of two. This does not apply to metered components configured for event-based billing (metric, meter, or
        formula). See `Hybrid Pricing <page:introduction/basic-concepts/hybrid-pricing>`__ for requirements and

        services.
