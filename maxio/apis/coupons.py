        Coupon Subcodes allow you to create a set of unique codes that allow you to expand the use of one coupon.

        + SPRING2020

        + DP80302

        When creating a coupon subcode, you must specify a coupon to attach it to using the coupon_id. Valid coupon
        subcodes are all capital letters, contain only letters and numbers, and do not have any spaces. Lowercase
        letters are capitalized before the subcode is created.

        Note: If you are using any of the allowed special characters ("%", "@", "+", "-", "_", and "."), you must encode
        them for use in the URL.

            % to %25
