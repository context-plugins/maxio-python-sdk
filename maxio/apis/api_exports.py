        Args:
            batch_id: Id of a Batch Job.
            per_page: This parameter indicates how many records to fetch in each request. Default value is 100. The
                maximum allowed values is 10000; any per_page value over 10000 will be changed to 10000.
            page: Result records are organized in pages. By default, the first page of results is displayed. The page
                parameter specifies a page number of results to fetch. You can start navigating through the pages to
                consume the results. You do this by passing in a page parameter. Retrieve the next page by adding
                ?page=2 to the query string. If there are no results to return, then an empty result set will be
