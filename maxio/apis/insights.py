                returned. Use in query ``page=1``.
            per_page: This parameter indicates how many records to fetch in each request. Default value is 20. The
                maximum allowed values is 200; any per_page value over 200 will be changed to 200. Use in query

        ## Understanding MRR movements

        This endpoint will aid in accessing your site's `MRR Report
        <https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24285894587021-MRR-Analytics>`__ data.

        Whenever a subscription event occurs that causes your site's MRR to change (such as a signup or upgrade), we
        record an MRR movement. These records are accessible via the MRR Movements endpoint.

        Each MRR Movement belongs to a subscription and contains a timestamp, category, and an amount. ``line_items``
        represent the subscription's product configuration at the time of the movement.

        ### Plan & Usage Breakouts

        In the MRR Report UI, we support a setting to `include or exclude
        <https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24285894587021-MRR-Analytics#displaying-component-based-metered-usage-in-mrr>`__
        usage revenue. In the MRR APIs, responses include ``plan`` and ``usage`` breakouts.

        Plan includes revenue from:
        * Products
        * Quantity-Based Components
        * On/Off Components

        Usage includes revenue from:
        * Metered Components
        * Prepaid Usage Components
