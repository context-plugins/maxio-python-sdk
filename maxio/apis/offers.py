        Offers allow you to package complicated combinations of products, components and coupons into a convenient
        package which can then be subscribed to just like products.

        Once an offer is defined it can be used as an alternative to the product when creating subscriptions.

        For more information, see `Offers
        <https://maxio.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/24261295098637-Offers-Overview>`__ in the product documentation.

        ## Using a Product Price Point

        You can optionally pass in a ``product_price_point_id`` that corresponds with the ``product_id`` and the offer
        will use that price point. If a ``product_price_point_id`` is not passed in, the product's default price point
        will be used.
