        ## Modified Authentication Process

        The Sales Commission API differs from other Chargify API endpoints. This resource is associated with the seller
        itself. Up to now all available resources were at the level of the site, therefore creating the API Key per site
        was a sufficient solution. To share resources at the seller level, a new authentication method was introduced,
        which is user authentication. Creating an API Key for a user is a required step to correctly use the Sales
        Commission API, more details `here
        <https://developers.chargify.com/docs/developer-docs/ZG9jOjMyNzk5NTg0-2020-04-20-new-api-authentication>`__.

        Access to the Sales Commission API endpoints is available to users with financial access, where the seller has
        the Advanced Analytics component enabled. For further information on getting access to Advanced Analytics
        contact Maxio support.
