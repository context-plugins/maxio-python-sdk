        a post-authentication flow where a 422 Unprocessable Entity status is returned with an action_link that will
        direct the customer through 3DS Authentication.

        In the event that you are using the Authorize.net, Stripe, Cybersource, Forte or Braintree Blue payment
        gateways, you can update just the billing and contact information for a payment method. Note the lack of
        credit-card related data contained in the JSON payload.

        In this case, the following JSON is acceptable:

        ```
        {
          "payment_profile": {
            "first_name": "Kelly",
            "last_name": "Test",

            "billing_address_2": null
          }
        }

        The result will be that you have updated the billing information for the card, yet retained the original card
        number data.

            payment gateway can update their Customer’s credit cards without passing in the full credit card number and
            CVV.

        - If you are using **Authorize.net**, **Cybersource**, **Forte**, **Braintree Blue** or **Stripe**, Advanced
            Billing will ignore the credit card number and CVV when processing an update via the API, and attempt a
            partial update instead. If you wish to change the card number on a payment profile, you will need to create
            a new payment profile for the given customer.

        - A Payment Profile cannot be updated with the attributes of another type of Payment Profile. For example, if
            the payment profile you are attempting to update is a credit card, you cannot pass in bank account
            attributes (like ``bank_account_number``), and vice versa.

        - Updating a payment profile directly will not trigger an attempt to capture a past-due balance. If this is the
            intent, update the card details via the Subscription instead.

        - If you are using Authorize.net or Stripe, you may elect to manually trigger a retry for a past due
            subscription after a partial update.

        ## 3D Secure (3DS) Authentication post-authentication flow

        When a payment requires 3DS Authentication to adhere to Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), the request enters
        a post-authentication flow where a 422 Unprocessable Entity status is returned with an action_link that will
        direct the customer through 3DS Authentication.

        See the `3D Secure Post-Authentication Flow
        <https://docs.maxio.com/hc/en-us/articles/44277749524365-3D-Secure-Post-Authentication-Flow>`__ article in the
        product documentation to learn how to manage the redirect flow.

        ## Partial Card Updates

        In the event that you are using the Authorize.net, Stripe, Cybersource, Forte or Braintree Blue payment
        gateways, you can update just the billing and contact information for a payment method. Note the lack of
        credit-card related data contained in the JSON payload.

        In this case, the following JSON is acceptable:

        ```
        {
          "payment_profile": {
            "first_name": "Kelly",
            "last_name": "Test",
            "billing_address": "789 Juniper Court",
            "billing_city": "Boulder",
            "billing_state": "CO",
            "billing_zip": "80302",
            "billing_country": "US",
            "billing_address_2": null
          }
        }
        ```

        The result will be that you have updated the billing information for the card, yet retained the original card
        number data.

        ## Specific notes on updating payment profiles

        - Merchants with **Authorize.net**, **Cybersource**, **Forte**, **Braintree Blue** or **Stripe** as their
            payment gateway can update their Customer’s credit cards without passing in the full credit card number and
            CVV.

        - If you are using **Authorize.net**, **Cybersource**, **Forte**, **Braintree Blue** or **Stripe**, Advanced
            Billing will ignore the credit card number and CVV when processing an update via the API, and attempt a
            partial update instead. If you wish to change the card number on a payment profile, you will need to create
            a new payment profile for the given customer.

        - A Payment Profile cannot be updated with the attributes of another type of Payment Profile. For example, if
            the payment profile you are attempting to update is a credit card, you cannot pass in bank account
            attributes (like ``bank_account_number``), and vice versa.

        - Updating a payment profile directly will not trigger an attempt to capture a past-due balance. If this is the
            intent, update the card details via the Subscription instead.

        - If you are using Authorize.net or Stripe, you may elect to manually trigger a retry for a past due
            subscription after a partial update.

        ## 3D Secure (3DS) Authentication post-authentication flow

        When a payment requires 3DS Authentication to adhere to Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), the request enters
        a post-authentication flow where a 422 Unprocessable Entity status is returned with an action_link that will
        direct the customer through 3DS Authentication.

        See the `3D Secure Post-Authentication Flow
        <https://docs.maxio.com/hc/en-us/articles/44277749524365-3D-Secure-Post-Authentication-Flow>`__ article in the
        product documentation to learn how to manage the redirect flow.

        You can use One Time Tokens while creating a subscription or payment profile instead of passing all bank account
        or credit card data directly to a given API endpoint.

        To obtain a One Time Token you have to use `Chargify.js
        <https://docs.maxio.com/hc/en-us/articles/38163190843789-Chargify-js-Overview#chargify-js-overview-0-0>`__.

        ## Partial Card Updates

        In the event that you are using the Authorize.net, Stripe, Cybersource, Forte or Braintree Blue payment
        gateways, you can update just the billing and contact information for a payment method. Note the lack of
        credit-card related data contained in the JSON payload.

        In this case, the following JSON is acceptable:

        ```
        {
          "payment_profile": {
            "first_name": "Kelly",
            "last_name": "Test",

            "billing_address_2": null
          }
        }
        ```

        The result will be that you have updated the billing information for the card, yet retained the original card
        number data.

        ## Specific notes on updating payment profiles

        - Merchants with **Authorize.net**, **Cybersource**, **Forte**, **Braintree Blue** or **Stripe** as their
            payment gateway can update their Customer’s credit cards without passing in the full credit card number and
            CVV.

        - If you are using **Authorize.net**, **Cybersource**, **Forte**, **Braintree Blue** or **Stripe**, Advanced
            Billing will ignore the credit card number and CVV when processing an update via the API, and attempt a
            partial update instead. If you wish to change the card number on a payment profile, you will need to create
            a new payment profile for the given customer.

        - A Payment Profile cannot be updated with the attributes of another type of Payment Profile. For example, if
            the payment profile you are attempting to update is a credit card, you cannot pass in bank account
            attributes (like ``bank_account_number``), and vice versa.

        - Updating a payment profile directly will not trigger an attempt to capture a past-due balance. If this is the
            intent, update the card details via the Subscription instead.

        - If you are using Authorize.net or Stripe, you may elect to manually trigger a retry for a past due
            subscription after a partial update.

        ## 3D Secure (3DS) Authentication post-authentication flow

        When a payment requires 3DS Authentication to adhere to Strong Customer Authentication (SCA), the request enters
        a post-authentication flow where a 422 Unprocessable Entity status is returned with an action_link that will
        direct the customer through 3DS Authentication.

        ## Partial Card Updates

        In the event that you are using the Authorize.net, Stripe, Cybersource, Forte or Braintree Blue payment
        gateways, you can update just the billing and contact information for a payment method. Note the lack of
        credit-card related data contained in the JSON payload.

        In this case, the following JSON is acceptable:

        ```
        {
          "payment_profile": {
            "first_name": "Kelly",
            "last_name": "Test",

            "billing_address_2": null
          }
        }
        ```

        The result will be that you have updated the billing information for the card, yet retained the original card
        number data.

        ## Specific notes on updating payment profiles

        - Merchants with **Authorize.net**, **Cybersource**, **Forte**, **Braintree Blue** or **Stripe** as their
            payment gateway can update their Customer’s credit cards without passing in the full credit card number and
            CVV.

        - If you are using **Authorize.net**, **Cybersource**, **Forte**, **Braintree Blue** or **Stripe**, Advanced
            Billing will ignore the credit card number and CVV when processing an update via the API, and attempt a
            partial update instead. If you wish to change the card number on a payment profile, you will need to create
            a new payment profile for the given customer.

        - A Payment Profile cannot be updated with the attributes of another type of Payment Profile. For example, if
            the payment profile you are attempting to update is a credit card, you cannot pass in bank account
            attributes (like ``bank_account_number``), and vice versa.

        - Updating a payment profile directly will not trigger an attempt to capture a past-due balance. If this is the
            intent, update the card details via the Subscription instead.

        - If you are using Authorize.net or Stripe, you may elect to manually trigger a retry for a past due
            subscription after a partial update.
